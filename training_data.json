          "problem": "Sally has a bagful of candy. She arranges it into an $a$ by $b$ grid, but she has $2a+b$ candies leftover. Her big sister Rita comes along and says, \"I can do better than that!\" Rita neatly arranges the candies into a $5a-4$ by $\frac{b-1}{3}$ grid and has none leftover. What is the maximum number of candies in Sally's bag?",
          "solution": "In Sally's arrangement, the number of candies is $ab+2a+b$. In Rita's arrangement, the number of candies is $\\left(5a-4\\right)\\left(\\frac{b-1}{3}\\right)$. The number of candies didn't change, so these two expressions are equal. Therefore, \\begin{align*} ab+2a+b&=(5a-4)\\left(\\frac{b-1}{3}\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 3ab+6a+3b&=(5a-4)(b-1)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 3ab+6a+3b&=5ab-4b-5a+4\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 0&=2ab-7b-11a+4\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ -4&=b(2a-7)-11a\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ -4+\\frac{11}{2}(7)&=b(2a-7)-\\frac{11}{2}(2a-7)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ \\frac{-8}{2}+\\frac{77}{2}&=\\left(b-\\frac{11}{2}\\right)(2a-7)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 69&=(2b-11)(2a-7). \\end{align*}The prime factorization of $69$ is $3\\cdot 23$. So we have the following possibilities. \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c} $2a-7$&$2b-11$&$2a$&$2b$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline $1$&$69$&$8$&$80$&$4$&$40$\\\\ $3$&$23$&$10$&$34$&$5$&$17$\\\\ $23$&$3$&$30$&$14$&$15$&$7$\\\\ $69$&$1$&$76$&$12$&$38$&$6$ \\end{tabular}We know from above, since Rita's arrangement must have integral dimensions, that $b-1$ is divisible by $3$. A check shows that the pairs $(a,b)$ that don't work are $(5,17)$ and $(38,6)$. Thus we have either $(a,b)=(15,7)$ or $(a,b)=(4,40)$. There are $ab+2a+b$ candies. In this first case we have $(15)(7)+2(15)+7=142$ candies. In the second case there are $(4)(40)+2(4)+40=208$ candies. Thus the maximum number of candies that could be in Sally's bag is $\\boxed{208}$.",

          "solution": "Usually when we apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we have two variables. Maybe we can find an adaptation for three variables. We notice that four of the terms on the left hand side have a factor of $z$ in them, so we can factor it out as: $$z(6xy+21x+2y+7)+30xy+105x+10y=812.$$This looks promising! Add $35$ to each side and continue factoring: \\begin{align*} z(6xy+21x+2y+7)+30xy+105x+10y+35&=812+35 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ z(6xy+21x+2y+7)+5(6xy+21x+2y+7)&=812+35 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ (z+5)(6xy+21x+2y+7)&=847. \\end{align*}Now we can proceed with the two-variable version of Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick on the remaining four-term factor: \\begin{align*} (z+5)(3x(2y+7)+2y+7)&=847 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ (z+5)(3x+1)(2y+7)&=847. \\end{align*}The prime factorization of $847$ is $7\\cdot 11^2$. We must find $3$ numbers which multiply to $847$ and assign them to $z+5$, $3x+1$, and $2y+7$. We know none of the factors can be negative, since then we would have a negative solution for $x$, $y$ or $z$, which must be positive numbers. Similarly, no factor can be $1$ because that would give either $z=-4$, $x=0$, or $y=-3$, none of which is allowable. There are only $3$ non-one factors which multiply to $847$, so in some order our three factors must be $7$, $11$, and $11$. We examine the $3x+1$ term. If this factor is equal to $11$, then $x=\\frac{10}{3}$, which is not an integer. So $3x+1=7$ and $x=2$. The remaining factors must equal $11$. Setting $2y+7=11$ gives $y=2$, and setting $z+5=11$ gives $z=6$. Thus $x+y+z=2+2+6=\\boxed{10}$.",

          "solution": "We use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick: observe that $ab + 2a + 3b = a(b+2) + 3b,$ so to obtain another factor of $b + 2$, we need to add $6.$ So $ab + 2a + 3b + 6 = a(b+2) + 3(b+2) = (a + 3)(b + 2),$ and $ab + 2a + 3b = (a + 3)(b+2) - 6.$ Thus we need to find how many integers $n$ with $76 \\le n \\le 96$ can be written as $(a + 3)(b + 2)$ for at least one ordered pair of positive integers $(a, b).$ Any $n$ that works must have the property that there exists positive integers $n_1$ and $n_2$ with $n_1n_2 = n$ and $n_1 > n_2 \\ge 3.$ Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to satisfy the condition that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. That is, $n = 78$ because $78 = 26 \\cdot 3 = (23 + 3)(1 + 2),$ but $n = 82$ doesn't because the only possible ways to decompose $82$ as a product of two positive integers are $41 \\cdot 2$ and $82 \\cdot 1,$ and in neither of those cases can both $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. The rest is a brute force check: we need to eliminate prime numbers, as they definitely don't allow us to have $a$ and $b$ be positive integers, and we need to eliminate numbers of the form $2p,$ where $p$ is prime. Every other number has a pair of factors $n_1$ and $n_2$ that satisfy $n_1n_2 = n$ and $n_1 > n_2 \\ge 3.$ We complementary count: $79, 83, 89$ are primes, and $82, 86, 94$ are twice a prime. Our answer is thus the total number of integers $n$ between $76$ and $96,$ minus $6,$ or simply $\\boxed{15}$.",

All the factors $z + 5$, $3x + 1$, $2y + 3$ are positive integers greater than 1, so they must be equal to 5, 7, 11 in some order. Furthermore, $z + 5$ is greater than 5, and there is no positive integer $x$ where $3x + 1 = 5$, so we must have $2y + 3 = 5$, which means $y = 1$. That leaves $z + 5$ and $3x + 1$ to be 7 and 11 in some order. There is no positive integer $x$ where $3x + 1 = 11$, so $3x + 1 = 7$ and $z + 5 = 11$. Hence, $x = 2$ and $z = 6$.
