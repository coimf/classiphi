          "problem": "Sally has a bagful of candy. She arranges it into an $a$ by $b$ grid, but she has $2a+b$ candies leftover. Her big sister Rita comes along and says, \"I can do better than that!\" Rita neatly arranges the candies into a $5a-4$ by $\frac{b-1}{3}$ grid and has none leftover. What is the maximum number of candies in Sally's bag?",
          "solution": "In Sally's arrangement, the number of candies is $ab+2a+b$. In Rita's arrangement, the number of candies is $\\left(5a-4\\right)\\left(\\frac{b-1}{3}\\right)$. The number of candies didn't change, so these two expressions are equal. Therefore, \\begin{align*} ab+2a+b&=(5a-4)\\left(\\frac{b-1}{3}\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 3ab+6a+3b&=(5a-4)(b-1)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 3ab+6a+3b&=5ab-4b-5a+4\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 0&=2ab-7b-11a+4\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ -4&=b(2a-7)-11a\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ -4+\\frac{11}{2}(7)&=b(2a-7)-\\frac{11}{2}(2a-7)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ \\frac{-8}{2}+\\frac{77}{2}&=\\left(b-\\frac{11}{2}\\right)(2a-7)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 69&=(2b-11)(2a-7). \\end{align*}The prime factorization of $69$ is $3\\cdot 23$. So we have the following possibilities. \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c} $2a-7$&$2b-11$&$2a$&$2b$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline $1$&$69$&$8$&$80$&$4$&$40$\\\\ $3$&$23$&$10$&$34$&$5$&$17$\\\\ $23$&$3$&$30$&$14$&$15$&$7$\\\\ $69$&$1$&$76$&$12$&$38$&$6$ \\end{tabular}We know from above, since Rita's arrangement must have integral dimensions, that $b-1$ is divisible by $3$. A check shows that the pairs $(a,b)$ that don't work are $(5,17)$ and $(38,6)$. Thus we have either $(a,b)=(15,7)$ or $(a,b)=(4,40)$. There are $ab+2a+b$ candies. In this first case we have $(15)(7)+2(15)+7=142$ candies. In the second case there are $(4)(40)+2(4)+40=208$ candies. Thus the maximum number of candies that could be in Sally's bag is $\\boxed{208}$.",

          "solution": "Usually when we apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we have two variables. Maybe we can find an adaptation for three variables. We notice that four of the terms on the left hand side have a factor of $z$ in them, so we can factor it out as: $$z(6xy+21x+2y+7)+30xy+105x+10y=812.$$This looks promising! Add $35$ to each side and continue factoring: \\begin{align*} z(6xy+21x+2y+7)+30xy+105x+10y+35&=812+35 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ z(6xy+21x+2y+7)+5(6xy+21x+2y+7)&=812+35 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ (z+5)(6xy+21x+2y+7)&=847. \\end{align*}Now we can proceed with the two-variable version of Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick on the remaining four-term factor: \\begin{align*} (z+5)(3x(2y+7)+2y+7)&=847 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ (z+5)(3x+1)(2y+7)&=847. \\end{align*}The prime factorization of $847$ is $7\\cdot 11^2$. We must find $3$ numbers which multiply to $847$ and assign them to $z+5$, $3x+1$, and $2y+7$. We know none of the factors can be negative, since then we would have a negative solution for $x$, $y$ or $z$, which must be positive numbers. Similarly, no factor can be $1$ because that would give either $z=-4$, $x=0$, or $y=-3$, none of which is allowable. There are only $3$ non-one factors which multiply to $847$, so in some order our three factors must be $7$, $11$, and $11$. We examine the $3x+1$ term. If this factor is equal to $11$, then $x=\\frac{10}{3}$, which is not an integer. So $3x+1=7$ and $x=2$. The remaining factors must equal $11$. Setting $2y+7=11$ gives $y=2$, and setting $z+5=11$ gives $z=6$. Thus $x+y+z=2+2+6=\\boxed{10}$.",

          "solution": "We use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick: observe that $ab + 2a + 3b = a(b+2) + 3b,$ so to obtain another factor of $b + 2$, we need to add $6.$ So $ab + 2a + 3b + 6 = a(b+2) + 3(b+2) = (a + 3)(b + 2),$ and $ab + 2a + 3b = (a + 3)(b+2) - 6.$ Thus we need to find how many integers $n$ with $76 \\le n \\le 96$ can be written as $(a + 3)(b + 2)$ for at least one ordered pair of positive integers $(a, b).$ Any $n$ that works must have the property that there exists positive integers $n_1$ and $n_2$ with $n_1n_2 = n$ and $n_1 > n_2 \\ge 3.$ Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to satisfy the condition that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. That is, $n = 78$ works because $78 = 26 \\cdot 3 = (23 + 3)(1 + 2),$ but $n = 82$ doesn't because the only possible ways to decompose $82$ as a product of two positive integers are $41 \\cdot 2$ and $82 \\cdot 1,$ and in neither of those cases can both $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. The rest is a brute force check: we need to eliminate prime numbers, as they definitely don't allow us to have $a$ and $b$ be positive integers, and we need to eliminate numbers of the form $2p,$ where $p$ is prime. Every other number has a pair of factors $n_1$ and $n_2$ that satisfy $n_1n_2 = n$ and $n_1 > n_2 \\ge 3.$ We complementary count: $79, 83, 89$ are primes, and $82, 86, 94$ are twice a prime. Our answer is thus the total number of integers $n$ between $76$ and $96,$ minus $6,$ or simply $\\boxed{15}.$",

All the factors $z + 5$, $3x + 1$, $2y + 3$ are positive integers greater than 1, so they must be equal to 5, 7, 11 in some order. Furthermore, $z + 5$ is greater than 5, and there is no positive integer $x$ where $3x + 1 = 5$, so we must have $2y + 3 = 5$, which means $y = 1$. That leaves $z + 5$ and $3x + 1$ to be 7 and 11 in some order. There is no positive integer $x$ where $3x + 1 = 11$, so $3x + 1 = 7$ and $z + 5 = 11$. Hence, $x = 2$ and $z = 6$.

Factoring $35$ shows that it has two pairs of factors: 1 and 35, and 5 and 7. Therefore, there are only two distinct solutions for $x$ and $y$ (it's easy to find these; simply set up a system of linear equations: for example, $x+y = 7$ and $x-y = 5$ yields $x = 6$ and $y = 1$). So, the number of distinct pairs of perfect squares that differ by $35$ is $\boxed{2}$.",

This makes 2 (for the order) $\times 2\times 2 = 8$ possibilities for the first and second places. Then the third and fourth places can be two possible arrangements of the losers.

In how many ways can this be done?",
          "solution": "Let $x$ denote the common sum of the numbers on each line. Then $4x$ gives the sum of all the numbers $A, B, \\ldots, J,$ but with $J$ counted four times. Since the sum of the numbers on the octagon must be $1 + 2 + \\dots + 9 = 45,$ we have $4x = 45 + 3J$ (where $J$ represents the number written at that vertex). Thus, $45 + 3J$ must be a multiple of $4$, which occurs exactly when $J \\in \\{1, 5, 9\\}.$ If $J = 1,$ then $4x = 45 + 3J = 48,$ so $x = 12.$ It follows that the sum of each pair of diametrically opposite vertices is $12 - 1 = 11,$ so we must pair up the numbers $\\{2, 9\\}$, $\\{3, 8\\}$, $\\{4, 7\\}$, and $\\{5, 6\\}.$ There are $4!$ ways to assign the four pairs, and then $2^4$ ways to assign the two numbers in each individual pair.

          "solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

          "solution": "There are a total of $6^5=7776$ possible sets of dice rolls. To get a pair without a three-of-a-kind, we can either have one pair and the other three dice all showing different numbers, or we have two pairs and the fifth die showing something different. In the first case, there are $6$ ways to pick which number makes a pair and $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to pick which $2$ of the $5$ dice show that number. Out of the other three dice, there are $5$ ways to pick a value for the first die so that that die doesn't match the pair, $4$ ways to pick a value for the second one so it doesn't match that die or the pair, and $3$ ways to pick a value for the last die so that it doesn't match any of the others. So there are $$6\\cdot 10\\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 6^2 \\cdot 100$$ways to roll this case. In the second case, to form two pairs and one die not part of those pairs, there are $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to pick which two numbers make the pairs, then $4$ ways to pick a value for the last die so that it doesn't match either of those pairs. There are $$\\frac{5!}{2!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 1!}=30$$ways order the five dice (equal to the number of ways to order XXYYZ), so that makes a total of $$15\\cdot 4 \\cdot 30 = 6^2\\cdot 50$$ways to roll this case. This makes a total of $$6^2 \\cdot 100 + 6^2 \\cdot 50 = 6^2 \\cdot 150 = 6^3 \\cdot 25$$ways to roll a pair without rolling a three-of-a-kind. So, the probability is $$\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}=\\frac{6^3 \\cdot 25}{6^5}=\\frac{25}{6^2}=\\boxed{\\frac{25}{36}}.$$",
