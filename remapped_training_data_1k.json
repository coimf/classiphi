    "problem": "Sally has a bagful of candy. She arranges it into an $a$ by $b$ grid, but she has $2a+b$ candies leftover. Her big sister Rita comes along and says, \"I can do better than that!\" Rita neatly arranges the candies into a $5a-4$ by $\\frac{b-1}{3}$ grid and has none leftover. What is the maximum number of candies in Sally's bag?",
    "solution": "In Sally's arrangement, the number of candies is $ab+2a+b$. In Rita's arrangement, the number of candies is $\\left(5a-4\\right)\\left(\\frac{b-1}{3}\\right)$. The number of candies didn't change, so these two expressions are equal. Therefore, \\begin{align*} ab+2a+b&=(5a-4)\\left(\\frac{b-1}{3}\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 3ab+6a+3b&=(5a-4)(b-1)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 3ab+6a+3b&=5ab-4b-5a+4\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 0&=2ab-7b-11a+4\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ -4&=b(2a-7)-11a\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ -4+\\frac{11}{2}(7)&=b(2a-7)-\\frac{11}{2}(2a-7)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ \\frac{-8}{2}+\\frac{77}{2}&=\\left(b-\\frac{11}{2}\\right)(2a-7)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 69&=(2b-11)(2a-7). \\end{align*}The prime factorization of $69$ is $3\\cdot 23$. So we have the following possibilities. \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c} $2a-7$&$2b-11$&$2a$&$2b$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline $1$&$69$&$8$&$80$&$4$&$40$\\\\ $3$&$23$&$10$&$34$&$5$&$17$\\\\ $23$&$3$&$30$&$14$&$15$&$7$\\\\ $69$&$1$&$76$&$12$&$38$&$6$ \\end{tabular}We know from above, since Rita's arrangement must have integral dimensions, that $b-1$ is divisible by $3$. A check shows that the pairs $(a,b)$ that don't work are $(5,17)$ and $(38,6)$. Thus we have either $(a,b)=(15,7)$ or $(a,b)=(4,40)$. There are $ab+2a+b$ candies. In this first case we have $(15)(7)+2(15)+7=142$ candies. In the second case there are $(4)(40)+2(4)+40=208$ candies. Thus the maximum number of candies that could be in Sally's bag is $\\boxed{208}$.",

We notice that four of the terms on the left hand side have a factor of $z$ in them, so we can factor it out as: $$z(6xy+21x+2y+7)+30xy+105x+10y=812.$$This looks promising! Add $35$ to each side and continue factoring: \\begin{align*} z(6xy+21x+2y+7)+30xy+105x+10y+35&=812+35 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ z(6xy+21x+2y+7)+5(6xy+21x+2y+7)&=812+35 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ (z+5)(6xy+21x+2y+7)&=847. \\end{align*}Now we can proceed with the two-variable version of Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick on the remaining four-term factor: \\begin{align*} (z+5)(3x(2y+7)+2y+7)&=847 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ (z+5)(3x+1)(2y+7)&=847. \\end{align*}The prime factorization of $847$ is $7\\cdot 11^2$. We must find $3$ numbers which multiply to $847$ and assign them to $z+5$, $3x+1$, and $2y+7$. We know none of the factors can be negative, since then we would have a negative solution for $x$, $y$ or $z$, which must be positive numbers. Similarly, no factor can be $1$ because that would give either $z=-4$, $x=0$, or $y=-3$, none of which is allowable. There are only $3$ non-one factors which multiply to $847$, so in some order our three factors must be $7$, $11$, and $11$. We examine the $3x+1$ term. If this factor is equal to $11$, then $x=\\frac{10}{3}$, which is not an integer. So $3x+1=7$ and $x=2$. The remaining factors must equal $11$. Setting $2y+7=11$ gives $y=2$, and setting $z+5=11$ gives $z=6$. Thus $x+y+z=2+2+6=\\boxed{10}$.",

    "solution": "We use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick: observe that $ab + 2a + 3b = a(b+2) + 3b,$ so to obtain another factor of $b + 2$, we need to add $6.$ So $ab + 2a + 3b + 6 = a(b+2) + 3(b+2) = (a + 3)(b + 2),$ and $ab + 2a + 3b = (a + 3)(b+2) - 6.$ Thus we need to find how many integers $n$ with $76 \\le n \\le 96$ can be written as $(a + 3)(b + 2)$ for at least one ordered pair of positive integers $(a, b).$ Any $n$ that works must have the property that there exists positive integers $n_1$ and $n_2$ with $n_1n_2 = n$ and $n_1 > n_2 \\ge 3.$ Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to satisfy the condition that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. That is, $n = 78$ because $78 = 26 \\cdot 3 = (23 + 3)(1 + 2),$ but $n = 82$ doesn't because the only possible ways to decompose $82$ as a product of two positive integers are $41 \\cdot 2$ and $82 \\cdot 1,$ and in neither of those cases can both $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. The rest is a brute force check: we need to eliminate prime numbers, as they definitely don't allow us to have $a$ and $b$ be positive integers, and we need to eliminate numbers of the form $2p,$ where $p$ is prime. Every other number has a pair of factors $n_1$ and $n_2$ that satisfy $n_1n_2 = n$ and $n_1 > n_2 \\ge 3.$ We complementary count: $79, 83, 89$ are primes, and $82, 86, 94$ are twice a prime. Our answer is thus the total number of integers $n$ between $76$ and $96,$ minus $6,$ or simply $\\boxed{15}$.",

Squaring both sides: $x + 2\\sqrt{x - 1} = a + b + 2\\sqrt{ab}$. Comparing terms: $a + b = x$ and $2\\sqrt{ab} = 2\\sqrt{x - 1}$, so $ab = x - 1$. We have $a + b = x$ and $ab = x - 1$. By Vieta's formulas, $a$ and $b$ are roots of $t^2 - xt + (x - 1) = 0$. Using the quadratic formula: $t = \\frac{x \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 4(x - 1)}}{2} = \\frac{x \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 4x + 4}}{2} = \\frac{x \\pm \\sqrt{(x - 2)^2}}{2} = \\frac{x \\pm |x - 2|}{2}$.

Multiplying by 4, we get $16k \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, which is equivalent to $k \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. So we can write $k=5j+4$ for some integer $j$. Substituting this back into the expression for $n$, we get $n=4(5j+4)+1 = 20j+16+1 = 20j+17$. Now we substitute this into the third congruence: $20j+17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}$. This simplifies to $2j+5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}$, so $2j \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}$. This means $2j=6m+4$ for some integer $m$, so $j=3m+2$. Substituting this back into the expression for $n$, we get $n=20(3m+2)+17 = 60m+40+17 = 60m+57$. We are looking for a number between 200 and 300. For $m=0$, $n=57$. For $m=1$, $n=117$. For $m=2$, $n=177$. For $m=3$, $n=237$. For $m=4$, $n=297$. The only value in the desired range is $\\boxed{237}$.",

This means $d = 1$, which contradicts our requirement that $d > 1$. Wait, let me reconsider. We need $\\gcd(2n+1, 3n+1) > 1$. Let $d = \\gcd(2n+1, 3n+1)$. Then $d$ divides $3(2n+1) - 2(3n+1) = 1$, so $d = 1$. This suggests no such $n$ exists. However, let me check small values: For $n = 1$: $2n+1 = 3$, $3n+1 = 4$, $\\gcd(3,4) = 1$. For $n = 2$: $2n+1 = 5$, $3n+1 = 7$, $\\gcd(5,7) = 1$. Actually, the calculation above shows that $\\gcd(2n+1, 3n+1) = 1$ for all positive integers $n$. There is no such positive integer $n$.",

Solutions: $(3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,3)$. That's 7 solutions. 3-digit: $x + y + z = 12$ where $1 \\leq x \\leq 9$ and $0 \\leq y,z \\leq 9$. Let $x' = x - 1$, so $x' + (y + z) = 11$ with $0 \\leq x' \\leq 8$. For each valid $x'$, we need $y + z = 11 - x'$ with $0 \\leq y,z \\leq 9$. If $11 - x' \\leq 9$, then there are $11 - x' + 1$ solutions. If $11 - x' > 9$, then there are $19 - (11 - x') = 8 + x'$ solutions.
