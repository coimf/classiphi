(b) Using (a) or otherwise, prove that $\\frac{(5m)!(5n)!}{m!n!(3m+n)!(3n+m)!}$ is integral for all positive integral $m$ and $n$. Note: A complete proof for this problem may require these results, and preferably also their proofs. If $[x] = a$, then $a \\le x < a + 1$. This is the alternate definition of $[x]$. If $a < b$, then $[a] \\le [b]$. This is easily proved by contradiction or consideration of the contrapositive. If $a$ is an integer, then $[x + a] = [x] + a$. This is proved from considering that $[x] + a \\le x + a < [x] + a + 1$. This is a known fact: the exponent of a prime $p$ in the prime factorization of $n!$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\left[ \\frac{n}{p^k} \\right]$. (Legendre's Formula) Lemma: For any pair of non-negative real numbers $x$ and $y$, the following holds:\n\n\\[[5x] + [5y] \\ge [x] + [y] + [3x + y] + [3y + x].\\]\n\nvcd We shall first prove the lemma statement for $0 \\le x, y < 1$. Then $[x] = [y] = 0$, and so we have to prove that\n\n\\[[5x] + [5y] \\ge [3x + y] + [3y + x].\\] Let $[5x] = a, [5y] = b$, for integers $a$ and $b$. Then $5x < a + 1 \\text{ and } 5y < b + 1$, and so $x < \\frac{a+1}{5}$ and $y < \\frac{b+1}{5}$. Define a new function, the ceiling function of x, to be the least integer greater than or equal to x. Also, define the trun-ceil function, $[[x]],$ to be the value of the ceiling function minus one. Thus, $[[a]] = a - 1$ if $a$ is an integer, and $[[a]] = [a]$ otherwise. It is not difficult to verify that if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers with $a < b$, then $[[a]] \\le [a] \\le [[b]]$. (The only new thing we have to consider here is the case where $b$ is integral, which is trivial.) Therefore,\n\n\n\\[[3x + y] + [3y + x] \\le \\left [ \\left [\\frac{3a+b+4}{5} \\right ] \\right] + \\left[\\left[\\frac{3b+a+4}{5} \\right]\\right] = S.\\] We shall prove that $S \\le a + b = T$ ; to do so, we list cases. Without loss of generality, let $a \\le b$. Because $x$ and $y$ are less than one, we have $a \\le b \\le 4.$ Then, we find, for all 15 cases: $a = 0, b = 0 \\rightarrow S = 0, T = 0.$ $a = 0, b = 1 \\rightarrow S = 1, T = 1.$ $a = 0, b = 2 \\rightarrow S = 2, T = 2.$ $a = 0, b = 3 \\rightarrow S = 3, T = 3.$ $a = 0, b = 4 \\rightarrow S = 4, T = 4.$ $a = 1, b = 1 \\rightarrow S = 2, T = 2.$ $a = 1, b = 2 \\rightarrow S = 3, T = 3.$ $a = 1, b = 3 \\rightarrow S = 3, T = 4.$ $a = 1, b = 4 \\rightarrow S = 5, T = 5.$ $a = 2, b = 2 \\rightarrow S = 4, T = 4.$ $a = 2, b = 3 \\rightarrow S = 4, T = 5.$ $a = 2, b = 4 \\rightarrow S = 5, T = 6.$ $a = 3, b = 3 \\rightarrow S = 6, T = 6.$ $a = 3, b = 4 \\rightarrow S = 6, T = 7.$ $a = 4, b = 4 \\rightarrow S = 6, T = 8.$ Thus, we have proved for all x and y in the range $[0, 1)$,\n\n\\[[5x] + [5y] = T \\ge S \\ge [3x + y] + [3y + x].\\] Now, we prove the lemma statement without restrictions on x and y. Let $x = [x] + \\{x\\}$, and $y = [y] + \\{y\\}$, where $\\{x\\}$, the fractional part of x, is defined to be $x - [x]$. Note that $\\{x\\} < 1$ as a result. Substituting gives the equivalent inequality \\[[5[x] + 5\\{x\\}] + [5[y] + 5\\{y\\}] \\ge [x] + [y] + [3[x] + 3\\{x\\} + [y] + \\{y\\}] + [3[y] + 3\\{y\\} + [x] + \\{x\\}].\\] But, because $[x] + a = [x + a]$ for any integer $a$, this is obtained from simplifications following the adding of $5[x] + 5[y]$ to both sides of \\[[5\\{x\\}] + [5\\{y\\}] \\ge [3\\{x\\} + \\{y\\}] + [3\\{y\\} + \\{x\\}],\\] which we have already proved (as $0 \\le \\{x\\}, \\{y\\} < 1$ ). Thus, the lemma is proved. Part (a) is a direct corollary of the lemma. For part (b), consider an arbitrary prime $p$. We have to prove the exponent of $p$ in $I = \\frac{(5m)!(5n)!}{m!n!(3m+n)!(3n+m)!}$ is non-negative, or equivalently that\n\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\frac{5m}{p^k} \\right] + \\left[ \\frac{5n}{p^k} \\right] \\right) \\ge \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\frac{m}{p^k} \\right] + \\left[ \\frac{n}{p^k} \\right] + \\left[ \\frac{3m+n}{p^k} \\right] + \\left[ \\frac{3n+m}{p^k} \\right] \\right).\\] But, the left-hand side minus the right-hand side of this inequality is\n\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\frac{5m}{p^k} \\right] + \\left[ \\frac{5n}{p^k} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{m}{p^k} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{n}{p^k} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{3m+n}{p^k} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{3n+m}{p^k} \\right] \\right),\\]\n\nwhich is the sum of non-negative terms by the Lemma. Thus, the inequality is proved, and so, by considering all primes $p$, we deduce that the exponents of all primes in $I$ are non-negative. This proves the integrality of $I$ (i.e. $I$ is an integer). $\\blacksquare$ ",
