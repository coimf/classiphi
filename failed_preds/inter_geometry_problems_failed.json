Joshua climbs to his feet and stands on his toes to make himself a half inch taller than his sister, who is ordinarily a half inch taller than Joshua. \"I'm measuring something. I'm designing something.\" Alexis stands on her toes too, reminding her brother that she is still taller than he. \"When you're done, can you design me a dress?\" \"Very funny.\" Joshua walks to the table and points to some drawings. \"I'm designing the sand castle I want to build at the beach. Everything needs to be measured out so that I can build something awesome.\" \"And this requires sniffing carpet?\" inquires Alexis, who is just a little intrigued by her brother's project. \"I was imagining where to put the base of a spiral staircase. Everything needs to be measured out correctly. See, the castle walls will be in the shape of a rectangle, like this room. The center of the staircase will be $9$ inches from one of the corners, $15$ inches from another, 16 inches from another, and some whole number of inches from the furthest corner.\" Joshua shoots Alexis a wry smile. The twins liked to challenge each other, and Alexis knew she had to find the distance from the center of the staircase to the fourth corner of the castle on her own, or face Joshua's pestering, which might last for hours or days. Find the distance from the center of the staircase to the furthest corner of the rectangular castle, assuming all four of the distances to the corners are described as distances on the same plane (the ground).

        "Tetrahedron $ABCD$ has $AD=BC=28$, $AC=BD=44$, and $AB=CD=52$. For any point $X$ in space, suppose $f(X)=AX+BX+CX+DX$. The least possible value of $f(X)$ can be expressed as $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$. Let $M$ and $N$ be midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$. The given conditions imply that $\\triangle ABD\\cong\\triangle BAC$ and $\\triangle CDA\\cong\\triangle DCB$, and therefore $MC=MD$ and $NA=NB$. It follows that $M$ and $N$ both lie on the common perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, and thus line $MN$ is that common perpendicular bisector. Points $B$ and $C$ are symmetric to $A$ and $D$ with respect to line $MN$. If $X$ is a point in space and $X'$ is the point symmetric to $X$ with respect to line $MN$, then $BX=AX'$ and $CX=DX'$, so $f(X) = AX+AX'+DX+DX'$. Let $Q$ be the intersection of $\\overline{XX'}$ and $\\overline{MN}$. Then $AX+AX'\\geq 2AQ$, from which it follows that $f(X) \\geq 2(AQ+DQ) = f(Q)$. It remains to minimize $f(Q)$ as $Q$ moves along $\\overline{MN}$. Allow $D$ to rotate about $\\overline{MN}$ to point $D'$ in the plane $AMN$ on the side of $\\overline{MN}$ opposite $A$. Because $\\angle DNM$ is a right angle, $D'N=DN$. It then follows that $f(Q) = 2(AQ+D'Q)\\geq 2AD'$, and equality occurs when $Q$ is the intersection of $\\overline{AD'}$ and $\\overline{MN}$. Thus $\\min f(Q) = 2AD'$. Because $\\overline{MD}$ is the median of $\\triangle ADB$, the Length of Median Formula shows that $4MD^2 = 2AD^2 + 2BD^2 - AB^2 = 2\\cdot 28^2 + 2 \\cdot 44^2 - 52^2$ and $MD^2 = 684$. By the Pythagorean Theorem $MN^2 = MD^2 - ND^2 = 8$. Because $\\angle AMN$ and $\\angle D'NM$ are right angles,\n\n\\[(AD')^2 = (AM+D'N)^2 + MN^2 = (2AM)^2 + MN^2 = 52^2 + 8 = 4\\cdot 678.\\]\n\nIt follows that $\\min f(Q) = 2AD' = 4\\sqrt{678}$.
