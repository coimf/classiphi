For example, he could start out with the ordered list $(0, 0, 0, 2)$. He counts three $0$ \u2019s, zero $1$ \u2019s, and one\n$2$, and then stops counting, so the second list is $(3, 0, 1)$ In the second list, he counts one $0$, one $1$,\nzero $2$ \u2019s, and one $3$, so the third list is $(1, 1, 0, 1)$.

Let $\\triangle ABC$ be a triangle where $BC = 219$ and $AB$ and $AC$ are positive integers. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{AC},$ respectively, and suppose that the splitting lines of $\\triangle ABC$ through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\\circ.$ Find the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC.$ Consider the splitting line through $M$. Extend $D$ on ray $BC$ such that $CD=CA$. Then the splitting line bisects segment $BD$, so in particular it is the midline of triangle $ABD$ and thus it is parallel to $AD$. But since triangle $ACD$ is isosceles, we can easily see $AD$ is parallel to the angle bisector of $C$, so the splitting line is also parallel to this bisector, and similar for the splitting line through $N$. Some simple angle chasing reveals the condition is now equivalent to $\\angle A=120^\\circ$. - MortemEtInteritum Let $PM$ and $QN$ be the splitting lines.

This gets that because $\\angle S_BCB = \\angle S_BCB' = \\angle S_BAB$ and $\\angle S_CBC = \\angle S_CBC' = \\angle S_CAC$, then $S_B$ and $S_C$ are on $\\triangle ABC$ 's circumcircle. Now, we know that $\\triangle S_BBB' \\sim \\triangle S_BAC$ and $\\triangle S_CCC' \\sim \\triangle S_CAB$ so because $BA=B'C$ and $CA=C'B$, then $S_BB=SBB'$ and $S_CC=S_CC'$ and $S_BQ \\perp BC$ and $S_CP \\perp BC$. We also notice that because $Q$ and $N$ correspond on $\\triangle S_BBB'$ and $\\triangle S_BAC$, and because $P$ and $M$ correspond on $\\triangle S_CCC'$ and $\\triangle S_CAB$, then the angle formed by $NQ$ and $BA$ is equal to the angle formed by $B'C$ and $NQ$ which is equal to $\\angle BS_BQ = \\angle QS_BB'$. Thus, $\\angle CBA=2\\angle CQN$. Similarly, $\\angle BCA = 2\\angle QPM$ and so $\\angle CBA + \\angle BCA = 2\\angle PQN + 2\\angle QPM = 60^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle A = 120^{\\circ}$. - kevinmathz We now need to solve $a^2+ab+b^2 = 3^2\\cdot 73^2$. A quick $(\\bmod 9)$ check gives that $3\\mid a$ and $3\\mid b$. Thus, it's equivalent to solve $x^2+xy+y^2 = 73^2$. Let $\\omega$ be one root of $\\omega^2+\\omega+1=0$. Then, recall that $\\mathbb Z[\\omega]$ is the ring of integers of $\\mathbb Q[\\sqrt{-3}]$ and is a unique factorization domain. Notice that $N(x-y\\omega) = (x-y\\omega)(x-y\\omega^2) = x^2+xy+y^2$. Therefore, it suffices to find an element of $\\mathbb Z[\\omega]$ with the norm $73^2$. To do so, we factor $73$ in $\\mathbb Z[\\omega]$. Since it's $1\\pmod 3$, it must split. A quick inspection gives $73 = (8-\\omega)(8-\\omega^2)$. Thus, $N(8-\\omega) = 73$, so\n\n\n\\begin{align*} 73^2 &= N((8-\\omega)^2) \\\\ &= N(64 - 16\\omega + \\omega^2) \\\\ &= N(64 - 16\\omega + (-1-\\omega)) \\\\ &= N(63 - 17\\omega), \\end{align*}\n\n\ngiving the solution $x=63$ and $y=17$, yielding $a=189$ and $b=51$, so the sum is $\\boxed{459}$. Since $8-\\omega$ and $8-\\omega^2$ are primes in $\\mathbb Z[\\omega]$, the solution must divide $73^2$. One can then easily check that this is the unique solution. - MarkBcc168 Denote $BC = a$, $CA = b$, $AB = c$.

Second, we find a lower bound of $q$. We have $q^2 + 3 p^2 < q^2 + 3 q^2 = 4 q^2$.\nHence, $4 q^2 > 146^2$.\nHence, $q > 73$.\nBecause $q$ is an integer, we must have $q \\geq 74$. Now, we find the integer solutions of $p$ and $q$ that satisfy Equation (2) with $74 \\leq q \\leq 131$. First, modulo 9,\n\n\n\\begin{align*} q^2 & \\equiv 146^2 - 3 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 4 - 3 \\cdot ( 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 ) \\\\ & \\equiv 4 \\mbox{ or } 1. \\end{align*} Hence $q \\equiv \\pm 1, \\pm 2 \\pmod{9}$. Second, modulo 5,\n\n\n\\begin{align*} q^2 & \\equiv 146^2 - 3 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 1 + 2 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 1 + 2 \\cdot ( 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } -1 ) \\\\ & \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } 3 \\mbox{ or } - 1. \\end{align*} Because $q^2 \\equiv 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } - 1$, we must have $q^2 \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } - 1$.\nHence, $5 \\nmid q$. Third, modulo 7,\n\n\n\\begin{align*} q^2 & \\equiv 146^2 - 3 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 1 - 3 \\cdot ( 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } 5 \\mbox{ or } 2 ) \\\\ & \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } 2 \\mbox{ or } 3 \\mbox{ or } 5. \\end{align*} Because $q^2 \\equiv 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } 2 \\mbox{ or } 4 \\pmod{ 7 }$, we must have $q^2 \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } 2 \\pmod{7}$.\nHence, $q \\equiv 1, 3, 4, 6 \\pmod{7}$. Given all conditions above, the possible $q$ are 74, 83, 88, 92, 97, 101, 106, 109, 116, 118, 127. By testing all these numbers, we find that the only solution is $q = 97$.\nThis implies $p = 63$. Hence, $b = 3p = 189$ and $d = 3q = 291$.\nHence, $c = \\frac{d - b}{2} = 51$. Therefore, the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $b + c + a = 189 + 51 + 219 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(459) }}$. ~Steven Chen (www.professorchenedu.com) We wish to solve the Diophantine equation $a^2+ab+b^2=3^2 \\cdot 73^2$. It can be shown that $3|a$ and $3|b$, so we make the substitution $a=3x$ and $b=3y$ to obtain $x^2+xy+y^2=73^2$ as our new equation to solve for. Notice that $r^2+r+1=(r-\\omega)(r-{\\omega}^2)$, where $\\omega=e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$. Thus,\n\n\n\\[x^2+xy+y^2 = y^2((x/y)^2+(x/y)+1) = y^2 (\\frac{x}{y}-\\omega)(\\frac{x}{y}-{\\omega}^2) = (x-y\\omega)(x-y{\\omega}^2).\\] Note that $8^2+1^2+8 \\cdot 1=73$. Thus, $(8-\\omega)(8-{\\omega}^2)=73$. Squaring both sides yields\n\n\n\\begin{align} (8-\\omega)^2(8-{\\omega}^2)^2&=73^2\\\\ (63-17\\omega)(63-17{\\omega}^2)&=73^2. \\end{align}\n\n\nThus, by $(2)$, $(63, 17)$ is a solution to $x^2+xy+y^2=73^2$. This implies that $a=189$ and $b=51$, so our final answer is $189+51+219=\\boxed{459}$. ~ Leo.Euler We look at upper and middle diagrams and get $\\angle BAC = 120^\\circ$.

Extend $AB$ and $NG$ so that the two lines intersect at $E$ and extend $AC$ and $MH$ so that the two lines intersect at $F$. Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be the corresponding side lengths for $\\angle A$, $\\angle B$, $\\angle C$. According to the question, $MH$ and $NG$ creates two sections of $\\triangle ABC$ of equal perimeter, we could list out the equations: $BG+C=a-BG$ $CH+b=a-BH$ $BG+GH+CH=a$ This results in: $BG=\\frac{a-c}{2}$ $CH=\\frac{a-b}{2}$ $GH=\\frac{b+c}{2}$ Now, we can apply the Menelaus Theorem to $\\triangle ABC$.\nLet $BE = x$ :\n\n\n\\[\\frac{BE}{AE}\\cdot\\frac{AN}{CN}\\cdot\\frac{CG}{BG} = 1\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{x+c}\\cdot1\\cdot\\frac{\\frac{a+c}{2}}{\\frac{a-c}{2}} = 1\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{x+c}\\cdot\\frac{a+c}{a-c} = 1\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\\frac{x+c}{x}=\\frac{a+c}{a-c}\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\\frac{c}{x}=\\frac{2c}{a-c}\\]\n\n\n\n\\[BE=x=\\frac{a-c}{2}=BG\\]\n\n\nSimilarly, $CF=CH$. Therefore, $\\angle BGE = \\angle E$ and $\\angle CHF = \\angle F$. Because the splitting lines of $\\triangle ABC$ through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\\circ$, $\\angle NOF$ = $30^\\circ$. $\\angle BGE+\\angle CHF=\\angle BGE+\\angle CHF=\\angle NOF=30^\\circ$. We conclude that $\\angle A=360^\\circ-\\angle E-\\angle F-\\angle EOF(reflex)=360^\\circ-30^\\circ-210^\\circ=120^\\circ$ Apply the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle ABC$ $c^2+a^2-2ac\\cos 120^\\circ=219^2$ $a^2+c^2+ac=219^2=47961$ To find the final answer, you would only need to solve this equation, which steps could be found in previous solutions. ~cassphe ",
