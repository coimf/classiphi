One day Joshua asks Michael if there are\nsimple patterns for the units digits when each one-digit integer is exponentiated in the manner above. Michael responds,\n\"You tell me!\" Joshua gives a disappointed look, but then Michael suggests that Joshua play around with some numbers\nand see what he can discover. \"See if you can find the units digit of $2008^{2008}$,\" Michael challenges. After a little while,\nJoshua finds an answer which Michael confirms is correct. What is Joshua's correct answer (the units digit of $2008^{2008}$ )? ",
