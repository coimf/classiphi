Just as a matter of general interest, the more difficult\nproblem is the subject of a discussion at\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/90894/product-of-six-consecutive-integers-being-a-perfect-square.\nAs of December 2024 there are several solutions presented\nin this discussion (I can make sense of two of them), as\nwell as two references to publications where the problem\nis solved.

This second paper proves a more\ngeneral statement: a product of any number of consecutive\nintegers can not be a perfect square.", "Let $\\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$ and $\\{m_4, m_5, m_6\\}$ be a partition\nof $\\{n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5\\}$. If a number $p \\ge 4$\nis a factor of $m_1m_2m_3,$ then $p$ must also be a factor\nof $m_4m_5m_6$. In particular, if $7$ is a factor of one\nof the numbers in $\\{n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5\\}$, then it\nmust be a factor of another, different number in this set.\nBut $7$ can be a factor of at most one of six consecutive\nintegers, so it is a factor of none of them.Since none of the numbers in $\\{n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5\\}$\nis divisible by $7$, the six values of $\\{q_i, i = 1, \\dots, 6\\}$\nfrom $n = q_1 \\mod 7, n_1 = q_2 \\mod 7, n_2 = q_3 \\mod 7, n_3 = q_4 \\mod 7, n_4 = q_5 \\mod 7, n_5 = q_6 \\mod 7$ are\n$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.So $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)(n+5) = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6 = 720 = 6 \\mod 7$.On the other hand, if $m$ is an integer, then $m^2 \\mod 7$\nis one of $0, 1, 2, 4$.

To shorten the text, when a number\n$N$ is a perfect square, we'll write $N = \\square$. Se we\nwant to prove a more difficult problem, namely\n$N = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)(n+5) \\ne \\square$. Assume for\nthe sake of reaching a contradiction that $N = \\square$.Regroup the factors of $N$ and do some multiplications. We\nget $(n^2 + 5n)[(n^2 + 5n) + 4][(n^2 + 5n) + 6] = \\square$.\nDenote $m = n^2 + 5n$. We have $m(m+4)(m+6) = \\square$.\nLet $m = p^2q$, such that all the prime factors of $q$ are at\npower $1$ (in other words, $p^2$ is the product of all the\nprime factors of $m$ at an even power, and $q$ is the product\nof all the remaining prime factors of $m$ ).Then, we have $q(p^2q + 4)(p^2q + 6) = \\square$. Multiplying,\nwe get that $q(Aq + 24) = \\square$ for some number $A$\n(in fact $A = p^4q + 10p^2$ ). Note that if a prime $a$\nis a factor of $q$, then it is a factor of the right hand\nside $\\square$, so $a^2$ is a factor of the right hand\nside $\\square$, so $a^2$ is a factor of $q(Aq + 24)$, so\n$a$ is a factor of $Aq + 24$, so $a$ is a factor of $24$.\nThis implies that $a = 2$ or $a = 3$, which in its turn\nimplies that $q = 2$, or $q = 3$ or $q = 6$ (since $q$ has\nits factors at power $1$ ).We will continue the proof by contradiction by taking\nthree cases (for $q = 2, 3, 6$ ), and showing that none of\nthe following three statements can be true:\n$2(2p^2 + 4)(2p^2 + 6) = \\square$,\n$3(3p^2 + 4)(3p^2 + 6) = \\square$,\n$6(6p^2 + 4)(6p^2 + 6) = \\square$.Case 1: $2(2p^2 + 4)(2p^2 + 6) = \\square$ becomes\n$2(p^2 + 2)(p^2 + 3) = \\square$. Note that $p^2 + 2$\nand $p^2 + 3$ have no common factors (since they differ\nby $1$ ) so eitherCase 1.1: $p^2 + 2 = \\square$ and $2(p^2 + 3) = \\square$orCase 1.2: $2(p^2 + 2) = \\square$ and $p^2 + 3 = \\square$Case 1.1 is impossible because $p^2 + 2 = \\square$ is\nimpossible (because two squares differ by more than $2$ ).Case 1.2 implies $p = 1$, because only the squares $1$\nand $4$ differ by $3$ (all higher squares differ by more\nthan $3$ ). But if $p = 1$ the other condition in case\n1.2 becomes $2(1 + 2) = \\square$, which is false.So Case 1 is impossible.Case 2: The condition becomes $(3p^2 + 4)(p^2 + 2) = \\square$.\nWe consider two sub-cases corresponding to $p =$ odd or $p =$\neven.Case 2.1: When $p =$ odd, $3p^2 + 4$ and $p^2 + 2$ have no common\nfactors because $3p^2 + 4$ and $3(p^2 + 2) = 3p^2 + 6$ have no\ncommon factors (because we have two odd numbers which differ by\n$2$ ). So we must have $3p^2 + 4 = \\square$ and\n$p^2 + 2 = \\square$. But this is impossible because of the latter\ncondition.Case 2.2: If $p =$ even, let $p = 2r$. The condition becomes\n$2(3r^2 + 1)(2r^2 + 1) = \\square$. Note that $3r^2 + 1$ and\n$2r^2 + 1$ have no common factors (because their multiples by\n$2$ and $3$ are $6r^2 + 2$ and $6r^2 + 3$ which differ by $1$ ).Case 2.2.1: Take the sub-sub-case $2(3r^2 + 1) = \\square$ and\n$2r^2 + 1 = \\square$. The first condition implies that we\nmust have $3r^2 + 1 = 2a^2$ for some $a$, or\n$3(r^2 + 1) = 2(a^2 + 1)$. But this is impossible, since\n$a^2 + 1$ can not be a multiple of $3$. (Indeed, take $a = 3b$,\n$a = 3b + 1$, $a = 3b + 2$ ; $a^2 = 0 \\mod 3$ or $a^2 = 1 \\mod 3$ ).Case 2.2.2: Take the sub-sub-case $3r^2 + 1 = \\square$ and\n$2(2r^2 + 1) = \\square$. The second condition is impossible\nbecause $2(2r^2 + 1)$ has exactly $2^1$ as a factor, so it\ncan not be a square.Case 3: $6(6p^2 + 4)(6p^2 + 6) = \\square$ becomes\n$2(3p^2 + 2)(p^2 + 1) = \\square$. We see that $3p^2 + 2$\nand $p^2 + 1$ have no common factors since $3p^2 + 2$ and\n$3(p^2 + 1) = 3p^2 + 3$ differ by $1$. So we haveCase 3.1: $2(3p^2 + 2) = \\square$ and $p^2 + 1 = \\square$.\nThis case is impossible, since the latter condition is\nimpossible (because two squares differ by more than $1$ ).Case 3.2: $3p^2 + 2 = \\square$ and $2(p^2 + 1) = \\square$.\nThe first condition implies $3(p^2 + 1) = a^2 + 1$, but this\nis impossible since as we saw in Case 2.2.2, $a^2 + 1$ can\nnot be a multiple of $3$.We looked at all possible cases, and they were impossible,\nso $N = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)(n+5)$ can not be a perfect square.[Solution by pf02, December 2024]"]}, "1972_usamo_problems/problem_1": {"id": {"year": 1972, "contest_name": "USAMO", "problem_number": 1}, "title": "1972 USAMO Problems/Problem 1", "problem": "The symbols $(a,b,\\ldots,g)$ and $[a,b,\\ldots, g]$ denote the greatest common divisor and least common multiple, respectively, of the positive integers $a,b,\\ldots, g$.

Now assume that $(1)$ is not true for all choices of $i$ and $k$. Let $i_0$ be the minimal value of $i$ for which $(1)$ fails for some $k$, let $k_0$ be the minimal value of $k > 1$ for which $x_{i_0,k}\\leq x_{i_0,1}$.

The length of each jump, that is, the difference between consecutive integers in $J_{i_0,k_0}$, is either 1 or a positive integer power of 2. The sequence $J_{i_0,k_0}$ cannot contain $2^{t_0}$ because it takes more jumps to reach $2^{t_0} k_0$ than it does to reach $2^{t_0}$. Let $2^{M+1}$, $M\\geq 0$ be the length of the longest jump made in generating $J_{i_0,k_0}$. Such a jump can only be made from a number that is divisible by $2^M$ (and by no higher power of 2). Thus we must have $M < i_0$, since otherwise a number divisible by $2^{i_0}$ is visited before $2^{i_0} k_0$ is reached, contradicting the definition of $k_0$.Let $2^{m+1}$ be the length of the jump when the frog jumps over $2^{i_0}$. If this jump starts at $2^m(2t - 1)$ for some positive integer $t$, then it will end at $2^m(2t - 1) + 2^{m+1} = 2^m(2t + 1)$. Since it goes over $2^{i_0}$ we see $2^m(2t - 1) < 2^{i_0} < 2^m(2t + 1)$ or $(2^{i_0-m} - 1)/2 < t < (2^{i_0-m} + 1)/2$. Thus $t = 2^{i_0-m-1}$ and the jump over $2^{i_0}$ is from $2^m(2^{i_0-m} - 1) = 2^{i_0} - 2^m$ to $2^m(2^{i_0-m}+1) = 2^{i_0} + 2^m$.Considering the jumps that generate $J_{i_0,k_0}$, let $N_1$ be the number of jumps from 1 to $2^{i_0} + 2^m$, and let $N_2$ be the number of jumps from $2^{i_0} + 2^m$ to $2^{i_0}k$. By definition of $i_0$, it follows that $2^m$ can be reached from 1 in less than $N_1$ jumps. On the other hand, because $m < i_0$, the number $2^{i_0}(k_0 - 1)$ can be reached from $2^m$ in exactly $N_2$ jumps by using the same jump length sequence as in jumping from $2^m + 2^{i_0}$ to $2^{i_0} k_0 = 2^{i_0}(k_0 - 1) + 2^{i_0}$. The key point here is that the shift by $2^{i_0}$ does not affect any of divisibility conditions needed to make jumps of the same length. In particular, with the exception of the last entry, $2^{i_0} k_0$, all of the elements of $J_{i_0,k_0}$ are of the form $2^p(2t + 1)$ with $p < i_0$, again because of the definition of $k_0$. Because $2^p(2t + 1) - 2^{i_0} = 2^p(2t - 2^{i_0-p} + 1)$ and the number $2t + 2^{i_0-p} + 1$ is odd, a jump of size $2^{p+1}$ can be made from $2^p(2t + 1) - 2^{i_0}$ just as it can be made from $2^p(2t + 1)$.Thus the frog can reach $2^m$ from 1 in less than $N_1$ jumps, and can then reach $2^{i_0}(k_0 - 1)$ from $2^m$ in $N_2$ jumps. Hence the frog can reach $2^{i_0}(k_0 - 1)$ from 1 in less than $N_1 + N_2$ jumps, that is, in fewer jumps than needed to get to $2^{i_0} k_0$ and hence in fewer jumps than required to get to $2^{i_0}$. This contradicts the definition of $k_0$."]}, "2007_imo_problems/problem_5": {"id": {"year": 2007, "contest_name": "IMO", "problem_number": 5}, "title": "2007 IMO Problems/Problem 5", "problem": "( Kevin Buzzard and Edward Crane, United Kingdom )\nLet $a$ and $b$ be positive integers.

Without loss of generality, suppose $-n\\notin S$. Let $U=\\{-n+1,-n+2,\\dots,n-2,n-1,n\\}$ (a set with $2n$ elements), so that $S\\subseteq U$ by our assumption. Now, the condition that $a+b+c\\neq 0$ for all $a,b,c\\in S$ implies that $-S\\cap(S_++S_-)=\\emptyset$.

Left to the reader.ANSWER: $\\{11a, a, 5a, 7a\\}$, $\\{a, 11a, 19a, 29a\\}$, for any positive integer $a$.(Note: The above solution looks generally correct, but the actual answer should be $\\{11a, a, 5a, 7a\\}$, $\\{a, 11a, 19a, 29a\\}$. You can check that $\\{a, 14a, 6a, 9a\\}$ doesn't actually work. -Someone who didn't write up the above solution but solved the problem in a similar way)", "Similarly to the first solution, let us order the terms in set $A$ by $0 < a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4$ since it is given that these four integers must be distinct and positive. Obviously, $s_a > 0$ from this. We know that pair $(a_3, a_4)$ cannot work because $2(a_3 + a_4) > a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = s_A.$ Additionally, pair $(a_2, a_4)$ cannot work for the same reason: $2(a_2 + a_4) = a_4 + a_4 + a_2 + a_2 > s_A.$Hence, since there were only ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs $(i, j)$ in total, and two pairs are guaranteed not to work, we are to find sets $A$ satisfying $n_A = 6 - 2 = 4.$ Due to our making $a_4$ the largest term of set $A$, the only way to have a pair $(a_i, a_4)$ that exists such that $a_i + a_4 | s_A$ is to make $i$ equal to 1 and find an $a_1$ such that $\\frac{s_A}{a_1 + a_4} = 2.$ When this happens, we know that $\\frac{s_A}{a_2 + a_3} = 2$, as well. It clearly follows that we need pairs $(a_1, a_2)$ and $(a_1, a_3)$ that exist such that both $a_1 + a_2$ and $a_1 + a_3$ divide $s_A.$To satisfy conditions $\\frac{s_A}{a_1 + a_4} = 2$ and $\\frac{s_A}{a_2 + a_3} = 2$, choose a set $A$ with four distinct positive integer elements $a - x, a, b, b + x$ with $0 < a - x < a < b < b + x.$ Obviously, $x < a < b$ for our set to consist solely of positive integers. The problem becomes to find $x, a,$ and $b$ such that $2a - x | 2(a + b)$ and $(a + b) - x | 2a + 2b.$We realize that $x$ can be any positive even integer. This allows $2a - x$ and $2(a + b)$ to have a common factor of 2, simplifying our problem a bit. Hence, $a - \\frac{x}{2}$ must divide $(a + b).$ Now, we can look at the other condition, $(a + b) - x | 2a + 2b$, to solve this problem. To find $a, b, x$ satisfying $(a + b) - x | 2a + 2b$, it suffices to define a positive integer $n$ that makes $n(a + b - x) = 2(a + b) \\Rightarrow 0 = (n - 2)a + (n - 2)b - nx \\Rightarrow (n - 2)(a + b) = nx.$ Note that $x$ must be less than $\\frac{a + b}{2}.$ If $x \\ge \\frac{a + b}{2}$, $(n - 2)(a + b) = nx$ would have solutions $x, a,$ and $b$ that will make $a - x < 0$, since $a < \\frac{a + b}{2}$ due to $a < b.$ This is a contradiction with the condition that each element in set $A$ has to be positive. Despite this, We move on to some cases.Thus, the only possible sets $A$ we have for satisfying the maximum $n_A$, which is 4, are $A = \\{p, 5p, 7p, 11p\\}$ and $\\{p, 11p, 19p, 29p\\}$, with $p$ being any positive integer since it is obvious that any $a$ that is a positive multiple of 5 or 11 makes $\\frac{a}{5}$ and $\\frac{a}{11}$ positive integers, respectively."]}, "2011_usamo_problems/problem_4": {"id": {"year": 2011, "contest_name": "USAMO", "problem_number": 4}, "title": "2011 USAMO Problems/Problem 4", "problem": "Consider the assertion that for each positive integer $n \\ge 2$, the remainder upon dividing $2^{2^n}$ by $2^n-1$ is a power of 4.

Thus, under the constraint of fixed element numbers, these $a_t$ minimize $\\mu$, proving Lemma 2.Lemma 3:\nContinuing from Lemma 2's notation, if $B=\\left\\{b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_{m-1}\\right\\} \\subseteq \\Omega$ is a good set with $b_j<b_{j+1}$, then the multiset\n\n\\[\\left\\{D\\left(b_t, b_{t+s}\\right), 0 \\leq t<m\\right\\}=\\left\\{D\\left(a_t, a_{t+s}\\right), 0 \\leq t<m\\right\\}\\]\n\nand both satisfy the necessary and sufficient condition from Lemma 1.\nProof of Lemma 3: A good set must satisfy\n\n\\[\\mu(A)=\\mu(B)=\\sum_{s=1}^{m-1} \\sum_{t=0}^{m-1} D\\left(b_t, b_{t+s}\\right)^2 \\geq \\sum_{s=1}^{m-1} \\sum_{t=0}^{m-1} D\\left(a_t, a_{t+s}\\right)^2=\\mu(A),\\]\n\nthus all\n\n\\[\\sum_{t=0}^{m-1} D\\left(b_t, b_{t+s}\\right)^2=\\sum_{t=0}^{m-1} D\\left(a_t, a_{t+s}\\right)^2\\]\n\nand by Lemma 1 (necessary and sufficient condition for minimizing the sum of squares), they are equal as multisets.Lemma 4: The complement of a good set is also a good set.Proof of Lemma 4:\n\n\\[\\mu(A)-\\mu(\\Omega \\backslash A) =\\sum_{x \\in A} \\sum_{y \\in A}(D(x, y))^2-\\sum_{x \\notin A} \\sum_{y \\notin A}(D(x, y))^2\\]\n\n\n\\[=\\sum_{x \\in A} \\sum_y(D(x, y))^2-\\sum_{x \\notin A} \\sum_y(D(x, y))^2=(2 \\# A-p)\\left(1^2 \\# A-p\\right)\\left(1^2+\\cdots+(p-1)^2\\right).\\]\n\nwhich only depends on \\#A, not the specific elements. Thus, the minimality of $\\mu(A)$ is equivalent to the minimality of $\\mu(\\Omega \\backslash A)$ when fixing the number of elements, making both good sets.Returning to the original problem:\nFirst, in the case of non-Mersenne primes (i.e., $p \\neq 2^k-1$ ), construct a chain of good sets of length $l=2\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\log _2 p\\right\\rfloor\\right)=2\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\log _2(p+1)\\right\\rfloor\\right)$. Choose any $x$ and denote\n\n\\[a_{t, m}:=\\left\\lfloor x+\\frac{t p}{m}\\right\\rfloor \\bmod p, \\quad t=0,1,2, \\ldots, m-1\\]\n\ntaking the smallest positive remainder. According to Lemma 2, for each given $m$, the above $a_{t, m}$ forms a good set denoted as $S_m$. Construct a chain of good sets of length $\\frac{l}{2}$ (choosing the same $x$ ):\n\n\\[A_1=S_1, A_2=S_2, A_3=S_4, \\ldots, A_{\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]}=S_{2^{\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]-1}}.\\]Their containment is quite obvious: in fact, $a_{t, m}=a_{2 t, 2 m}$.\nThe key is how to connect the good set of $2^{\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]-1}$ elements to the good set of $p-$ $2^{\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]-1}$ elements. In fact, let $B:=S_{2\\left(\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]-1\\right)+1} \\bmod p($ taking the smallest positive remainder). It is easy to verify $B \\cap A_{1+\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]}=\\emptyset$. Obviously, $B$ is also a good set, so $\\Omega-$ $B$ is also a good set with $p-2^{\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]-1}$ elements and contains $A_{1+\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]}$. We only need to let\n\n\\[A_{\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]+j}:=\\Omega \\backslash\\left(A_{\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]+1-j}+1 \\bmod p\\right), \\quad j=1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lfloor\\log _2 p\\right\\rfloor,\\]\n\nto complete the construction of the chain of good sets of length $l$.\nFor Mersenne primes (i.e., $p=2^k-1$ ), we need to construct a chain of good sets of length $l=2 k$. Choose any $x$, and according to Lemma 2, the good set of elements $2^{k-1}=\\frac{p+1}{2}$ is denoted as $S_{2^{k-1}}$ as $A_{k+1}$. Let $A_k=\\Omega-\\left(A_{k+1}+1 \\bmod p\\right)$. Note that the intervals between elements of $A_{k+1}$ are 1 and all 2, so $A_k \\subseteq A_{k+1}$ and contains one less element. We alternately split the elements of $A_{k+1}$ into two parts:\n\n\\[\\left\\{\\left\\lfloor x+\\frac{t p}{2^{k-1}}\\right\\rfloor \\bmod p\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\left\\lfloor x+\\frac{t p}{2^{k-2}}\\right\\rfloor \\bmod p\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{\\left\\lfloor x+\\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}+\\frac{t p}{2^{k-2}}\\right\\rfloor \\bmod p\\right\\}\\]\n\nwhich are disjoint and both good sets (Lemma 2), with one part contained in $A_k$ (corresponding to $y=x$ or $y=x+\\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}$ ). Define them as $A_{k-1}$ and let\n\n\\[A_j:=S_{2^{j-1}}(y)=\\left\\{\\left\\lfloor y+\\frac{t p}{2^{j-1}}\\right\\rfloor \\bmod p\\right\\}, \\quad j=1,2, \\ldots, k-1,\\]\n\nand then let\n\n\\[A_{2 k+1-j}:=\\Omega-\\left(A_j+1 \\bmod p\\right), \\quad j=1,2, \\ldots, k-1,\\]\n\nwhich are all good sets by Lemma 4, thus constructing a chain of good sets of length $l=$ $2 k$.Now prove the optimality of $l=2\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\log _2(p+1)\\right\\rfloor\\right)$. We attempt to estimate the gap: if $1 \\leq a<b<\\frac{p}{3}$, and $A \\subseteq B$ are both good sets with $\\# A=a$ and $\\# B=b$, we will prove $b \\geq 2 a$.\nWe use contradiction. Suppose $b<2 a$. Consider the interval composition of elements of $A$ (in the $\\bmod p$ ring), assuming they are some number $t(\\geq 4)$ and some number $t+1$. Since the number of new points in $B$ (i.e., $B \\backslash A$ ) is fewer than in $A$, they cannot exist between each pair of elements in $A$, so the interval composition of elements in $B$ must include $t$ or $t+1$. If the interval composition of $B$ includes $t+1$, then splitting the interval in $A$ will result in an interval less than $t$, contradicting $B$ being a good set (Lemma 1). Thus, the interval composition of elements in $B$ can only be $t$ and $t-1 \\geq 3$ (note $b<\\frac{p}{3}$ ). But splitting an interval of $t+1$ in $A$ results in intervals still within $t$ and $t-1$, so $t=3$, contradiction.If $1 \\leq a<b<\\frac{p}{2}$, and $A \\subseteq B$ are both good sets with $\\# A=a$ and $\\# B=b$ but $b<2 a$, similarly to the above reasoning, we infer: the interval composition of elements in $A$ must be 4 or 3, and the interval composition of elements in $B$ must be 3 or 2. The elements of $B \\backslash A$ must all divide the intervals of length 4 in $A$.We further assert that $B$ (or $A$ ) does not contain two adjacent intervals of length 3. Otherwise, the \"sum of lengths of two adjacent segments\" in $B$ will simultaneously include 4, 5, and 6, contradicting the characterization of good sets by Lemma 3.We further assert: the number of intervals of length 3 in $B$ (or $A$ ) must be 1. Otherwise, let the number of intervals of length 3 be $k$, and the number of intervals of length 4 between any two elements in $A$ be positive integers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$ (they split into twice as many intervals of length 2 in $B$ ), satisfying\n\n\\[3 k+4\\left(c_1+c_2+\\cdots+c_k\\right)=p.\\]Clearly, these $c_i$ are not all equal (since $p$ is prime). Let $c=\\min c_i$, consider the \"sum of lengths of $2 c+2$ adjacent segments\" in $B$, which can span over $2 c$ intervals of length 2 and extend by one interval of length 3 on each side (note that some $c_i=c$ ), resulting in a total length of $4 c+6$. But since not all $c_i$ are equal, at least one $c_i \\geq c+1$, so there exists $2 c+2$ adjacent intervals of length 2 in $B$, with a total length of $4 c+4$. This contradicts the characterization of good sets by Lemma 3.That is, \"in most cases\", if $1 \\leq a<b<\\frac{p}{2}$, and $A \\subseteq B$ are both good sets with \\#A $=a$ and \\#B=b, then $b \\geq 2 a$. The only exceptional case is $p=4 t-1, a=t$, and $b=2 t-1$.Within the range of element numbers not exceeding $\\frac{p}{2}$, the number of elements in each $A_k$ in the chain of good sets is\n\n\\[\\{1\\},\\{2,3\\},\\{4,5,6,7\\}, \\ldots,\\left\\{2^{\\left[\\log _2 p\\right]-1}, \\ldots, \\frac{p-1}{2}\\right\\}.\\]When $p$ is a non-Mersenne prime, at most one number can appear in each of these sets; for Mersenne primes, the last set may contain at most 2, while the others can contain only 1. This upper chain has a length of $\\left[\\log _2(p+1)\\right]$.By Lemma 4, within the range of element numbers exceeding $\\frac{p}{2}$, the upper limit of the length of the chain of good sets is also $\\left[\\log _2(p+1)\\right]$, proving the overall upper limit.~xiaohuangya|szm"]}, "1968_imo_problems/problem_6": {"id": {"year": 1968, "contest_name": "IMO", "problem_number": 6}, "title": "1968 IMO Problems/Problem 6", "problem": "For every natural number $n$, evaluate the sum\n\n\n\\[\\sum_{k = 0}^\\infty\\bigg[\\frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k + 1}}\\bigg] = \\Big[\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\Big] + \\Big[\\frac{n + 2}{4}\\Big] + \\cdots + \\bigg[\\frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k + 1}}\\bigg] + \\cdots\\]\n\n\n(The symbol $[x]$ denotes the greatest integer not exceeding $x$.)", "answer_choices": "frq", "answer": "", "solutions": ["I shall prove that the summation is equal to $n$.Let the binary representation of $n$ be $\\overline{d_xd_{x-1}\\dots d_1d_0}_2$, where $d_i\\in\\{0,1\\}$ for all $i$, and $x=\\lfloor \\log_2 n\\rfloor$.

Obviously, one working permutation of $[n]$ is simply $(1, 2, \\ldots, n)$ ; this is acceptable, as $ka_k$ is always $k^2$ in this sequence.Lemma 1. We can permute any numbers that, when each divided by the largest perfect square that divides it, yield equal quantities $p$.Proof. Let $p_k$ and $m_k$ be the values of $p$ and $m$, respectively, for a given $k$ as defined above, such that $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. We can obviously permute two numbers which have the same $p$, since if $p_j = p_w$ where $j$ and $w$ are 2 values of $k$, then $j\\cdot w = p_j^2\\cdot m_j^2\\cdot m_w^2$, which is a perfect square. This proves that we can permute any numbers with the same value of $p$.End LemmaLemma 2. We will prove the converse of Lemma 1: Let one number have a $p$ value of $\\phi$ and another, $\\gamma$. $\\phi\\cdot f$ and $\\gamma\\cdot g$ are both perfect squares.Proof. $\\phi\\cdot f$ and $\\gamma\\cdot g$ are both perfect squares, so for $\\phi\\cdot \\gamma$ to be a perfect square, if $g$ is greater than or equal to $f$, $g/f$ must be a perfect square, too. Thus $g$ is $f$ times a square, but $g$ cannot divide any squares besides $1$, so $g = 1f$ ; $g = f$. Similarly, if $f\\geq g$, then $f = g$ for our rules to keep working.End LemmaWe can permute $l$ numbers with the same $p$ in $l!$ ways. We must have at least 67 numbers with a certain $p$ so our product will be divisible by 67. Obviously, then it will also be divisible by 2, 3, and 5, and thus 2010, as well. Toms as $h$, in general, we need numbers all the way up to $h\\cdot 67^2$, so obviously, $67^2$ is the smallest such number such that we can get a $67!$ term; here 67 $p$ terms are 1.

We find that we can not permute the non squares around because $n$ (not a perfect square) $*a_w$ where $w \\neq n$ will not give a perfect square. But we can permute the perfect squares around to other perfect squares since a square times a square makes another square we can do this (# of squares below $n$ )! times. So now we need to find $n = a^2$ such that $a!$ is divisible by $2010$ which largest prime factor is $67$ so, $n$ is $n$ is $67^2 = \\boxed{4489}$\n~bjump", "We have to somehow calculate the number of permutations for a given $n$. How in the world do we do this? Because we want squares, why not call a number $k=m*s^2$, where $s$ is the largest square that allows $m$ to be non-square? $m=1$ is the only square $m$ can be, which only happens if $k$ is a perfect square.For example, $126 = 14 * 3^2$, therefore in this case $k=126, m = 14, s = 3$.I will call a permutation of the numbers $P$, while the original $1, 2, 3, 4,...$ I will call $S$.Note that essentially we are looking at \"pairing up\" elements between $P$ and $S$ such that the product of $P_k$ and $S_k$ is a perfect square. How do we do this? Using the representation above.Each square has to have an even exponent of every prime represented in its prime factorization. Therefore, we can just take all exponents of the primes $mod 2$ and if there are any odd numbers, those are the ones we have to match- in effect, they are the $m$ numbers mentioned at the beginning.By listing the $m$ values, in my search for \"dumb\" or \"obvious\" ideas I am pretty confident that only values with identical $m$ s can be matched together. With such a solid idea let me prove it.If we were to \"pair up\" numbers with different $m$ s, take for example $S_{18}$ with an $m$ of $2$ and $P_{18}=26$ with an $m$ of $26$, note that their product gives a supposed $m$ of $13$ because the $2$ values cancel out. But then, what happens to the extra $13$ left? It doesn't make a square, contradiction. To finish up this easy proof, note that if a \"pair\" has different $m$ values, and the smaller one is $m_1$, in order for the product to leave a square, the larger $m$ value has to have not just $m_1$ but another square inside it, which is absurd because we stipulated at the beginning that $m$ was square-free except for the trivial multiplication identity, 1.Now, how many ways are there to do this? If there are $c_1$ numbers with $m=1$, there are clearly $(c_1)!$ ways of sorting them. The same goes for $m=2, 3, etc.$ by this logic. Note that the $P(n)$ as stated by the problem requires a $67$ thrown in there because $2010=2*3*5*67$, so there has to be a $S_n$ with 67 elements with the same $m$. It is evident that the smallest $n$ will occur when $m=1$, because if $m$ is bigger we would have to expand $n$ to get the same number of $m$ values. Finally, realize that the only numbers with $m=1$ are square numbers! So our smallest $n=67^2=4489$, and we are done.I relied on looking for patterns a lot in this problem.

(Basically how many factors of p you can take out of k)Note that if $f(k) \\neq f(a_k)$, By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, $f(k)$ and $f(a_k)$ 's prime factorization are different, and thus there exists a prime p, such that $v_p(f(k)) \\neq v_p(f(a_k))$. Also, since $f(k)$ and $f(a_k)$ is squarefree, $v_p(k), v_p(a_k) \\leq 1$. Thus, $v_p(k \\cdot a_k) = 1$, making $k \\cdot a_k$ not a square.Thus, we can only match k with $a_k$ if they have the same f value.

Notice that we have $(a_1, a_2,... a_n)$ as our permutation of the set $(1, 2,..., n)$. Essentially, the problem is asking us to find the number of permutations of this original set such that $a_1, 2a_2,..., na_n$ are all perfect squares. From here, we realize that we could write the following:$a_1 = (p_1)^{2}$$a_2 = 2(p_2)^{2}$...$a_n = n(p_n)^{2}$Thus, we just transformed this problem into the question that how many ways are there such that the elements of the form $n(p_n)^{2}$ are elements of the original set $[n]$. We could easily solve this by looking at ranges. First, we realize $1 \\leq (p_1)^{2} \\leq n$. Solving, we get $1 \\leq p_1 \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\right\\rfloor$. Thus, there are $\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\right\\rfloor$ possibilities for $p_1$. We can now see the pattern by solving the following inequalities and find the total number of permutations are: $\\prod_{1 \\leq i \\leq n} \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{i}} \\right \\rfloor$ Thus, we need $2010 = 2*3*5*67$ to divide that product. Notice this means we need the prime factors $2, 3, 5, 67$ to divide that product. Base cases tells us that the prime factors of $2, 3, 5$ are trivial but $67$ needs to be focused on. We need $67$ to divide that product. This tells us that $\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{i}} \\right \\rfloor$ must be divisible by $67$. Already, we can tell that $n$ has to be at least $67^{2} = 4489$ for this to even hold. This would be the minimum $n$ for $67$ to divide that product. We can test out $4489$ and see that we get factors of $2, 3, 5$ in the product along with our intention of including the prime factor of $67$.
