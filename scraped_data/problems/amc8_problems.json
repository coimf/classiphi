Therefore, the first shaded area has $4 \\pi - \\pi = 3 \\pi$ area. The circle has total area $9 \\pi$, so the other shaded region must have $1.5 \\pi$ area, as the non-shaded and shaded area is equivalent. So for the 3rd outer ring, the total area is $9 \\pi - 4 \\pi = 5 \\pi$, so the non-shaded part of the outer ring is $5 \\pi - 1.5 \\pi = 3.5 \\pi$.Now as said before, the ratio of these two areas is the ratio of $\\angle{BOC}$ and $360 - \\angle{BOC}$.

Plot the rectangle on the Cartesian plane at the vertices $(0,0),(p,0),(q,p),(0,q).$ The diagonal has endpoints at $(0,0),(q,p)$, so its slope is $\\frac{p}{q}.$ Now, suppose the diagonal goes through the corner point $(a,b)$, where $a<q$ and $b<p$. The slope of this line is $\\frac{b}{a}$, which must be equal to $\\frac{p}{q},$ implying that $\\frac{p}{q}$ can be reduced, contradicting the fact that $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime. We conclude that no corner points of a grid entry (unit square) are crossed. \\\\\\\\ Since no corner points are crossed, each time the diagonal crosses either a horizontal or vertical grid line, exactly one more unit square is touched by the diagonal. There are $p-1$ horizontal lines and $q-1$ vertical lines, so there are $p + q - 2$ total lines crossed by the diagonal. This doesn't include the square in the bottom left corner, crossed initially.

In every round, there are two games; the players are split into two pairs and the people in those pairs play each other. Thus, every round should have $2$ winners and $2$ losers which means that every column of the win-loss table should have $2$ $1$ 's and $2$ $0$ 's.

In the fourth column, we see that Lola and Lolo both lost, and Tiya is the only one who won (1), so Tiyo also won (1).

If you have closely studied magic squares, you might know that in a three by three magic square that is to be filled in with the integers $1$ through $9$, the center of the square would be $5$ (the average of the numbers), and the numbers in the corners should be even(*). The such pairs (disregarding order) are $(2,8)$ and $(4,6).$ Let\u2019s fix the position of $2$ to be the top left corner. This would make $8$ in the bottom right corner.

Label the nine small squares within the magic square from $a$ to $i$ from left to right, top to bottom. Firstly, we know that $a+i$ and $c+g$ sum to $10$ since the center square is $5$. Thus, $a$ and $i$ must have the same parity, and so must $c$ and $g$. Suppose that $a$ and $c$ have different parity. Since $a+b+c=15$, $b$ must be even. By a similar argument, $h$ must also be even, and so must $d$ and $f$. Our initial assumption is that one of $a$ and $c$ is odd and the other is even; however, we end up with six even numbers needed to fill in the square, but there are only four even integers from $1$ to $9$. Now suppose that all of $a, c, g,$ and $i$ are odd. This would make each of $b, d, f,$ and $h$ odd, but clearly we do not have enough odd numbers to make all nine numbers odd. Thus, each corner square must be even.~ Brian__Liu",
      "To start, we must find the value that all three groups must add to, which is $\\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9}{3} = 15.$. Then, we can notice that the numbers $1, 2,$ and $3$ must be in different groups because two of them and any other digit 1-9 added together cannot produce 15 (For example, $2+3=5$ which means that we need a $10$ to sum to 15. In the same way, $7, 8,$ and $9$ cannot be placed in the same group because putting them in the same group would make the numbers greater than 15 (For example, $7+8=15$, meaning that it would be impossible to add another number with making the sum greater than 15. Now, we can just use trial and error to solve the problem (this is feasible because there are only $3*2=6$ ways to pair a number $1-3$ and $7-9$ and then add another number $4-6$ in order to sum to 15. By trial and error, we see that 1 and 7 must not be paired together because to have a sum of 15, there must be another 7 in the group (The problem only lets us use 1 of each number). This eliminates two of the options we are considering. Now, we only have to check the 4 options where 7 is not in a group with 1.By trial and error, we can see that only two cases work:1. $(1,8,6); (2,9,4); (3,7,5)$ and 2. $(1,9,5); (2,7,6); (3,8,4)$Because we only have two options, the answer is $B$",

The red line shows the right-hand edge of the original board.The total number of paths from $P$ to $Q$, including invalid paths which cross over the red line, is then the number of paths which make $4$ steps up-and-right and $3$ steps up-and-left, which is $\\binom{4+3}{3} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35$. We need to subtract the number of invalid paths, i.e. the number of paths that pass through $X$ or $Y$. To get to $X$, the marker has to make $3$ up-and-right steps, after which it can proceed to $Q$ with $3$ steps up-and-left and $1$ step up-and-right. Thus, the number of paths from $P$ to $Q$ that pass through $X$ is $1 \\cdot \\binom{3+1}{3} = 4$. Similarly, the number of paths that pass through $Y$ is $\\binom{4+1}{1}\\cdot 1 = 5$. However, we have now double-counted the invalid paths which pass through both $X$ and $Y$ ; from the diagram, it is clear that there are only $2$ of these (as the marker can get from $X$ to $Y$ by a step up-and-left and a step-up-and-right in either order). Hence the number of invalid paths is $4+5-2=7$, and the number of valid paths from $P$ to $Q$ is $35-7 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }28}$.",
      "On any white square, we may choose to go left or right, as long as we do not cross over the border of the board. Call the moves $L$ and $R$ respectively.

However, we originally promised that we will not go over the border, and now we have to subtract the paths that do go over the border. The paths that go over the border are any paths that start with RRR(1 path), RR(5 paths) and LRRR(1 path) so our final number of paths is $35-7=\\boxed{(A)=28}.$ ~PEKKA",

There are two ways to choose for row 2, and another two ways to choose for row 3. However, you can go to the \"edge\" or the farthest possible square westward of Q, so you can't multiply by 2 again. Notice how, at the first step, we figured that the answer was even, so choice D and E are eliminated, and after the second row, we realized it must be a multiple of 4, so choice B is eliminated. When we get to the fourth row, we do not multiply by 2 again, since we have limited possibilities rather than multiplying by 2 again. Choice C implies that there are two possibilities per row; however, we know that if you go to the farthest possible, you only have one possibility, so it is not $2^5 = 32$ so we know that the answer is choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$. ~hh99754539",

    "problem": "Five different awards are to be given to three students. Each student will receive at least one award. In how many different ways can the awards be distributed?",

    "solutions": [
      "Firstly, observe that a single student can't receive $4$ or $5$ awards because this would mean that one of the other students receives no awards. Thus, each student must receive either $1$, $2$, or $3$ awards. If a student receives $3$ awards, then the other two students must each receive $1$ award; if a student receives $2$ awards, then another student must also receive $2$ awards and the remaining student must receive $1$ award. We consider each of these two cases in turn.If a student receives three awards, there are $3$ ways to choose which student this is, and $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways to give that student $3$ out of the $5$ awards. Next, there are $2$ students left and $2$ awards to give out, with each student getting one award. There are clearly just $2$ ways to distribute these two awards out, giving $3\\cdot\\binom{5}{3}\\cdot 2=60$ ways to distribute the awards in this case.In the other case, two students receive $2$ awards and one student receives $1$ award. We know there are $3$ choices for which student gets $1$ award. There are $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways to do this. Then, there are $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to give the first student his two awards, leaving $3$ awards yet to be distributed. There are then $\\binom{3}{2}$ ways to give the second student his $2$ awards. Finally, there is only $1$ student and $1$ award left, so there is only $1$ way to distribute this award. This results in $\\binom{5}{2}\\cdot\\binom{3}{2}\\cdot 1\\cdot 3 =90$ ways to distribute the awards in this case. Adding the results of these two cases, we get $60+90=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }150}$.",
      "Upon inspection (specified in the above solution), there are two cases of the distribution of awards to the students: one student gets 3 awards and the other each get 1 award or one student gets 1 award and the other two get 2 awards.In the first case, there are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose the person who gets 3 awards. From here, there are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to choose the 3 awards from the 5 total awards. Now, one person has $2$ choices for awards and the other has $1$ choice for the award. Thus, the total number of ways to choose awards in this case is $3 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 60$.In the other case, there are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose the person who gets 1 award, and $5$ choices for his/her award. Then, one person has $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to have his/her awards and the other person has $\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1$ ways to have his/her awards. This gives $3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1 = 90$ ways for this case.Adding these numbers together, we get $60 + 90 = 150$ ways to distribute the awards, or choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }150}$.",
      "Without the restriction that each student receives at least one award, we could take each of the awards and choose one of the $3$ students to give it to. This would be $3^5$ ways to distribute the awards in total. Now we need to subtract the cases where at least one student doesn't receive an award. If a student doesn't receive an award, there are $3$ choices for which student that is, so $2^5$ ways of choosing a student to receive each of the awards; in total, $3\\cdot32=96$.However, if $2$ students both don't receive an award, then this case would be counted twice among the $96$, so we need to add back in these cases. Said in other words, $2$ students not receiving an award is equivalent to $1$ student receiving $5$ awards, and there are $3$ choices for whom that student would be. To finish, the total number of ways to distribute the awards is $243 - 96+3$, or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }150}$."

      "Let the side length of $S_2$ be s, and the shorter side length of $R_1$ and $R_2$ be $r$. We haveFrom this diagram, it is evident that $r+s+r=2020$. Also, the side length of $S_1$ and $S_3$ is $r+s$. Then, $r+s+s+r+s=3322$. Now, we have 2 systems of equations.We can see an $r+s+r$ in the 2nd equation, so substituting that in gives us $2020+2s=3322 \\Rightarrow 2s= 1302 \\Rightarrow s=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }651}$.",

      "Note: This solution uses the non-negative version for stars and bars. A solution using the positive version of stars is similar (first removing an apple from each person instead of 2).This method uses the counting method of stars and bars (non-negative version). Since each person must have at least $2$ apples, we can remove $2*3$ apples from the total that need to be sorted. With the remaining $18$ apples, we can use stars and bars to determine the number of possibilities. Assume there are $18$ stars in a row, and $2$ bars, which will be placed to separate the stars into groups of $3$. In total, there are $18$ spaces for stars $+ 2$ spaces for bars, for a total of $20$ spaces. We can now do $20 \\choose 2$. This is because if we choose distinct $2$ spots for the bars to be placed, each combo of $3$ groups will be different, and all apples will add up to $18$. We can also do this because the apples are indistinguishable. $20 \\choose 2$ is $190$, therefore the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }190}$.~goofytaipan91",

Notice that we only have $1$ way to assign the numbers $a,b,c$ to Alice, Becky, and Chris when $a=b=c$. As this only happens $1$ way ( $a=b=c=8$ ), our answer is $1+3y+6z$ for some $y,z$.

This shows that $abcd$ = 1.Therefore either $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are all positive or negative, or 2 are positive and 2 are negative.There are 2 ways where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are 1 (1, 1, 1, 1) and (-1, -1, -1, -1)There are 6 ways where 2 variables are positive and 2 are negative: (1, 1, -1, -1), (1, -1, 1, -1), (-1, 1, 1, -1), (-1, -1, 1, 1), (-1, 1, -1, 1), and (-1, -1, 1, 1).So the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 8}$.Note: This result can also be achieved by realizing that there are $4! / 2! 2! = 6$ ways to arrange $2$ negatives and $2$ positives and $1$ way each to arrange four of one sign.~atharvd~cxsmi (Note)",

Because of $6x+2=11z+7$, then $6x=11z+5=6z+5(z+1)$, so $(z+1)$ must be a multiple of 6. Because of $9y+5=11z+7$, then $9y=11z+2=9z+2(z+1)$, so $(z+1)$ must also be a multiple of $9$.

So a+b can either be 2 or 12. a+b cannot be 2 because then there will be only 3 numbers that work and that isn't in the answer choice. So a+b=12. To check this we can do ab+ba=132 which equals to (a+b)0+(a+b)=132 and since we said a+b=12 we get 120+12=132 which is true. So we have a+b=12 and a<10 and b<10.If a is 9 then b=3 and if a=3 then b=9 calculating how many pairs are in between you get 7. So the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 7}.$"

      "(This solution is similar to Solution 2.) Let's make this a problem with boxes.In total, there are 9 products derived from these numbers (because 3 numbers per box). This would be our denominator.Every time a spinner lands on 2, we get an even product. These are $(1,2)$, $(2,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(2,3)$, and finally $(3,2)$.Going back, we see there are $3\\cdot3=9$ possible combinations, and we have $5$ evens, the final answer is$\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.You can also make this problem into a spinner problem. You have the first spinner with $3$ equally dividedsections: $1, 2$, and $3$. You make a second spinner that is identical to the first, with $3$ equal sections of$1$, $2$, and $3$. If the first spinner lands on $1$, it must land on two for the result to be even. You write down the firstcombination of numbers: $(1,2)$. Next, if the spinner lands on $2$, it can land on any number on the secondspinner. We now have the combinations of $(1,2),(2,1), (2,2),$ and $(2,3)$. Finally, if the first spinner ends on $3$, wehave $(3,2).$ Since there are $3\\cdot3=9$ possible combinations, and we have $5$ evens, the final answer is$\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.We can also list out the numbers. Box A has chips $1$, $2$, and $3$, and Box B also has chips $1$, $2$, and $3$. Chip $1$ (from Box A)could be with 3 partners from Box B. This is also the same for chips $2$ and $3$ from Box A. $3+3+3=9$ total sums. Chip $1$ could be multiplied with 2 other chips to make an even product, just like chip $3$. Chip $2$ can only multiply with 1 chip. $2+2+1=5$. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.Here is another way:Let's start by finding the denominator: Total choices. There are $3$ chips we can choose from in the 1st box, and $3$ chips we can choose from in the 2nd box. We do $3*3$, and get $9$. Now - to find the numerator: Desired choices. To get an even number, we need to pick 2 from at least one of the boxes. There are $2$ choices as to finding which box we will draw the 2 from. Then, we have $3$ choices from the other box to pick any of the other chips, $1, 2,$ and $3$.$\\frac{3 \\cdot2}{9} = \\frac{6}{9}$However, we are over counting the $(2,2)$ configuration twice, and so, we subtract that one configuration from our total. $\\frac{6}{9} - \\frac{1}{9}$. Thus, our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.~ del-math.This might take longer to solve, but you definitely will have the right answer. You first list out all the possible combinations regardless if the product is even or odd. $1 \\cdot 1 = 1.$ $1 \\cdot 2 = 2.$ $1 \\cdot 3 = 3.$ $2 \\cdot 1 = 2.$ $2 \\cdot 2 = 4.$ $2 \\cdot 3 = 6.$ $3 \\cdot 1 = 3.$ $3 \\cdot 2 = 6.$ $3 \\cdot 3 = 9.$ There are 9 possible combinations and $5$ of the combinations\u2019 products are even. So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.~MiracleMathsWe can use complementary counting to solve this problem. If we want to find the number of ways for the product to be odd, then the chip chosen from either box has to be $1$ or $3$. Since there are 2 ways out of 3 to pick an even chip from a box, the probability of picking an even chip from a box is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Since there are $2$ boxes, we can find that the answer is $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}$ = $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.~JQTX941016"

      "The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is equal to half the product of its base and height. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we find its height is $\\sqrt{1^2+2^2}=\\sqrt{5}$, and its base is $\\sqrt{2^2+4^2}=\\sqrt{20}$. We multiply these and divide by $2$ to find the area of the triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{5 \\cdot 20}}2=\\frac{\\sqrt{100}}2=\\frac{10}2=5$. Since the grid has an area of $30$, the fraction of the grid covered by the triangle is $\\frac 5{30}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{1}{6}}$.Note angle $\\angle ACB$ is right; thus, the area is $\\sqrt{1^2+3^2} \\times \\sqrt{1^2+3^2}\\times \\dfrac{1}{2}=10 \\times \\dfrac{1}{2}=5$ ; thus, the fraction of the total is $\\dfrac{5}{30}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}~\\dfrac{1}{6}}$.By the Shoelace Theorem, the area of $\\triangle ABC=|\\dfrac{1}{2}(15+4+4-1-20-12)|=|\\dfrac{1}{2}(-10)|=5$.This means the fraction of the total area is $\\dfrac{5}{30}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}~\\dfrac{1}{6}}$.The smallest rectangle that follows the grid lines and completely encloses $\\triangle ABC$ has an area of $12$, where $\\triangle ABC$ splits the rectangle into four triangles. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is therefore $12 - (\\frac{4 \\cdot 2}{2}+\\frac{3 \\cdot 1}{2}+\\frac{3 \\cdot 1}{2}) = 12 - (4 + \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}) = 12 - 7 = 5$. That means that $\\triangle ABC$ takes up $\\frac{5}{30} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}~\\frac{1}{6}}$ of the grid.Using Pick's Theorem, the area of the triangle is $4 + \\dfrac{4}{2} - 1=5$. Therefore, the triangle takes up $\\dfrac{5}{30}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}~\\frac{1}{6}}$ of the grid.We can find the lengths of the sides by using the Pythagorean Theorem. Then, we apply Heron's Formula to find the area. This simplifies to Again, we simplify to get The middle two terms inside the square root multiply to $5$, and the first and last terms inside the square root multiply to $\\sqrt{10}^2-\\sqrt{5}^2=10-5=5.$ This means that the area of the triangle is The area of the grid is $6\\cdot 5=30.$ Thus, the answer is $\\frac{5}{30}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{1}{6}}$.First, count the number of shapes inside the main triangle (you should count 10). Then, upon closer inspection, most of the shapes that are not a single unit on the triangle can be created by connecting another shape. The only exceptions are one shape that is a single unit and one that would need 2 shapes connected to it to make a single unit. On average, you need to connect 2 shapes to make a unit. Knowing this, if there are 10 shapes and you require 2 shapes to make a unit, 10 divided by 2 equals 5, which is the area.5 is 1/6 of 30(the total of the graph) and so the final answer is $\\frac{5}{30}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{1}{6}}$. -Themathnerd3.14"

Some of the socks he bought cost $$1$ a pair, some of the socks he bought cost $$3$ a pair, and some of the socks he bought cost $$4$ a pair. If he bought at least one pair of each type, how many pairs of $$1$ socks did Ralph buy?",

      "So, let there be $x$ pairs of $$1$ socks, $y$ pairs of $$3$ socks, and $z$ pairs of $$4$ socks.We have $x+y+z=12$, $x+3y+4z=24$, and $x,y,z \\ge 1$.Now, we subtract to find $2y+3z=12$, and $y,z \\ge 1$. It follows that $2y$ is a multiple of $3$ and $3z$ is a multiple of $3$. Since sum of 2 multiples of 3 = multiple of 3, so we must have $2y=6$.Therefore, $y=3$, and it follows that $z=2$. Now, $x=12-y-z=12-3-2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~7}$, as desired.Since the total cost of the socks was $$24$ and Ralph bought $12$ pairs, the average cost of each pair of socks is $\\frac{$24}{12} = $2$.There are two ways to make packages of socks that average to $$2$. You can have:$\\bullet$ Two $$1$ pairs and one $$4$ pair (package adds up to $$6$ )$\\bullet$ One $$1$ pair and one $$3$ pair (package adds up to $$4$ )Now, we need to solve where $a$ is the number of $$6$ packages and $b$ is the number of $$4$ packages. We see our only solution (that has at least one of each pair of sock) is $a=2, b=3$, which yields the answer of $2\\times2+3\\times1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~7}$.Since there are 12 pairs of socks, and Ralph bought at least one pair of each, there are $12-3=9$ pairs of socks left. Also, the sum of the three pairs of socks is $1+3+4=8$. This means that there are $24-8=16$ dollars left. If there are only $1$ dollar socks left, then we would have $9\\cdot1=9$ dollars wasted, which leaves $7$ more dollars. If we replace one pair with a $3$ dollar pair, then we would waste an additional $2$ dollars. If we replace one pair with a $4$ dollar pair, then we would waste an additional $3$ dollars. The only way $7$ can be represented as a sum of $2$ s and $3$ s is $2+2+3$. If we change $3$ pairs, we would have $6$ pairs left. Adding the one pair from previously, we have $\\boxed{(\\text{D})~7}$ pairs.Let the amount of $1$ dollar socks be $a$, $3$ dollar socks be $b$, and $4$ dollar socks be $c$. We then know that $a+b+c=12$ and $a+3b+4c=24$. We can make $a+b+c=12$ into $a=12-b-c$ and then plug that into the other equation, producing $12-b-c+3b+4c=24$ which simplifies to $2b+3c=12$. It's not hard to see $b=3$ and $c=2$. Now that we know $b$ and $c$, we know that $a=7$, meaning the number of $1$ dollar socks Ralph bought is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 7}$.If Ralph bought one sock of each kind, he already used $$8$, so there are $$16$ left and 9 socks. If we split the $$16$ into four $$4$ sections, (as it is the smallest possible number that 1, 3, 4, can make in different ways that in all use at least each of the numbers once,) if Ralph bought a $$3$ pair, he would need to buy a $$1$ pair in order for it to add up to a multiple of four. Similarly, if Ralph bought a $$1$ pair, he would either need to buy three $$1$ pairs or a $$3$ pair. If Ralph bought a $$4$ pair, it would already make a group. Now, the problem is just how we can split 9 into 4 groups of 1, 2, or 4. We clearly see that $1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9$, or a $$4$ pair, two $$3$ pairs, and six $$1$ pairs. Because we subtracted the necessary one of each kind, there are two $$4$ pairs, three $$3$ pairs, and seven $$1$ pairs. Therefore, the number of $$1$ pairs Ralph bought is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~7}$. ~strongstephenTo simplify the problem, we can reduce the price of each sock by $$1$, resulting in the prices being $$0$, $$2$ and $$3$. This means the total price Ralph spends becomes $$24-12\\times$1=$12$. Now the $$0$ socks aren't worth anything, but we still need to keep in mind there are at least one of them, so the question becomes: at most 11 of $$2$ and $$3$ socks add up to $$12$. It is obvious that $3\\times$2+2\\times$3=$12$, so the number of $$0$ socks (actually $$1$ socks) is $12-3-2=7$.Note: this is very similar to Solution 1, but a non algebraic way of thinking about it.-bbidev"

Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}~12}$. ~strongstephenNote: Another more complicated way to find out if angle KBC is right, is that we can extend line AB to a point L on triangle KBC. Now, since we know that angle IJB is right, and we know that line IJ now acts as a transversal to lines IJ and AL. That means angle IJB(90 degrees) must be equal to angle JBL by the alternate-exterior angle rule. Since we know that triangle JKB is equilateral, angle JBK will be 60 degrees, hence angle KBL will be 90 - 60 = 30 degrees. Now, we move on to figure ABCDEF. Through the solution above, we know that angle ABC is 120 degrees, so we can use the same line AL which will result in the formation of a linear pair of angles: angles ABC and CBL. Since the angles in a linear pair always add up to 180, and angle ABC is 120, angle CBL = 180 - 120 = 60 degrees. Notice that angle CBL and angle KBL together make up angle KBC. Hence, by the value of 30 degrees derived for angle KBL, angle KBC = angle KBL + angle CBL = 30 degrees + 60 degrees = 90 degrees."

This looks good at first as we have slips smaller than that, but upon closer inspection, we see that no slip fits exactly.

To prove this fact, draw a diagonal of the square and find congruent triangles). Let the shorter leg of the big triangle be $x$ ; then $\\dfrac{x}{x-1}=\\dfrac{5-x}{1}$. Thus, $x=\\dfrac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, because by symmetry, $x < \\dfrac52$.

      "There are two possible interpretations of the problem: that the road as a whole is $40$ feet wide, or that each lane is $40$ feet wide. Both interpretations will arrive at the same result. However, let us stick with the first interpretation for simplicity. Each lane must then be $20$ feet wide, so Robert must be riding his bike in semicircles with radius $20$ feet and diameter $40$ feet. Since the road is $5280$ feet long, over the whole mile, Robert rides $\\frac{5280}{40} =132$ semicircles in total. Were the semicircles full circles, their circumference would be $2\\pi\\cdot 20=40\\pi$ feet; as it is, the circumference of each is half that, or $20\\pi$ feet. Therefore, over the stretch of highway, Robert rides a total of $132\\cdot 20\\pi =2640\\pi$ feet, equivalent to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ miles.

    "solutions": [
      "Let the hundreds, tens, and units digits of the original three-digit number be $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively. We are given that $a=c+2$. The original three-digit number is equal to $100a+10b+c = 100(c+2)+10b+c = 101c+10b+200$. The hundreds, tens, and units digits of the reversed three-digit number are $c$, $b$, and $a$, respectively. This number is equal to $100c+10b+a = 100c+10b+(c+2) = 101c+10b+2$. Subtracting this expression from the expression for the original number, we get $(101c+10b+200) - (101c+10b+2) = 198$. Thus, the units digit in the final result is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 8}$",
      "The result must hold for any three-digit number with hundreds digit being $2$ more than the units digit. $301$ is such a number. Evaluating, we get $301-103=198$. Thus, the units digit in the final result is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 8}$",
      "Set the units digit of the original number as $x$. Thus, its hundreds digit is $x+2$. After the digits are reversed, the hundreds digit of the original number will be the units digit of the new number. Since $x-(x+2) = -2$, we can do regrouping and \"borrow\" $1$ from the tens digit and bring it to the units digit as a $10$. Therefore, the units digit will end up as $-2 + 10 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 8}$~Bloggish",

If we remove the common factor of $5^{8}$ from both expressions, we are left with $2^{8}$, which equals 256, and $5^{4}$, which equals 625. So we know that $5^{12}$ is bigger than $10^{8}$. Now we need to figure out which is bigger, $10^{8}$ or $2^{24}$. To do this, we rewrite $2^{24}$ as $(2^{3})^{8}=(8)^{8}$, which is clearly less than $10^{8}$.

The largest three-digit whole number divisible by $9$ is $999$, so our maximum value for $x$ is $\\frac{999}{9}=111$.

    "solutions": [
      "At the beginning of the problem, the Unicorns had played $y$ games and they had won $x$ of these games. From the information given in the problem, we can say that $\\frac{x}{y}=0.45.$ Next, the Unicorns win 6 more games and lose 2 more, for a total of $6+2=8$ games played during district play. We are told that they end the season having won half of their games, or $0.5$ of their games. We can write another equation: $\\frac{x+6}{y+8}=0.5.$ This gives us a system of equations: $\\frac{x}{y}=0.45$ and $\\frac{x+6}{y+8}=0.5.$ We first multiply both sides of the first equation by $y$ to get $x=0.45y.$ Then, we multiply both sides of the second equation by $(y+8)$ to get $x+6=0.5(y+8).$ Applying the Distributive Property gives yields $x+6=0.5y+4.$ Now we substitute $0.45y$ for $x$ to get $0.45y+6=0.5y+4.$ Solving gives us $y=40.$ Since the problem asks for the total number of games, we add on the last 8 games to get the solution $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 48}$.",
      "We can check each answer choice from left to right to see which one is correct. Suppose the Unicorns played $48$ games in total. Then, after district play, they would have won $24$ games. Now, consider the situation before district play. The Unicorns would have won $18$ games out of $40$. Converting to a percentage, $18/40 = 45\\%$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 48}$.Note: If A didn't work, we would have similarly tested the other choices until we found one that did.~cxsmi",
      "We know that $45\\%=\\frac9{20}$. Therefore, the number of games before district play must be a multiple of $20$ in order for the number of games won to be an integer. The Unicorns played $6+2=8$ more games during district play. The only answer choice that is $8$ more than a multiple of $20$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 48}$.",
      "At the start of the problem we figure out the Unicorns have won $45\\%$ of their games, which can be represented by $\\frac9{20}$. Since this is a simplified fraction and not necessarily the amount of games they have played, we can add a variable (in this case I am using $x$ ) to the numerator and denominator to get $\\frac{9x}{20x}$. We then know that during the district play they have won 6 more games and lost 2 of them for a total of 6+2=8 games played. We then can add it to our fraction we have built to make $\\frac{9x+6}{20x+8}$. We also know that the fraction is equal to $\\frac1{2}$. Putting these equations together we get $\\frac{9x+6}{20x+8}=\\frac1{2}$. Now we can cross multiply to come out with $18x+12=20x+8$. We now solve for $x$ ! $18x+12=20x+8$ ----> $4=2x$ ----> $2=x$. After we get $x$ which comes out to be 2 we then plug it back into the denominator to get $20(2)+8$ which is equal to 48, so the answer must be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 48}$.~AM24"

You could either find the absolute areas (as is done below for completeness), or apply some proportional reasoning and symmetry to realize the relative areas (which is really all that matters).The area of this entire smaller circle is $9\\pi$. The area of each smaller section then must be $\\frac{9\\pi}{3}$ or $3\\pi$. The larger sections trisect a \"ring\" which is the difference of two circles, one with radius $3$, the other radius $6$. So, the area of the ring (annulus) is $36\\pi - 9\\pi$ or $27\\pi$. The area of each larger section must be $\\frac{27\\pi}{3}$ or $9\\pi$.

      "Drawing segments $AC$ and $BD$, the number of triangles outside square $ABCD$ is the same as the number of triangles inside the square. Thus areas must be equal so the area of $ABCD$ is half the area of the larger square which is $\\frac{60}{2}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 30 }$.If the side length of the larger square is $x$, the side length of the smaller square is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot x}{2}$. Therefore the area of the smaller square is $\\frac{x^2}{2}$, half of the larger square's area, $x^2$.Thus, the area of the smaller square in the picture is $\\frac{60}{2}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 30 }$.The smaller square forms four congruent isosceles right triangles whose legs measure half of the larger square's side length. Since the larger square has an area of $60$, its sides measure $\\sqrt{60}=2\\sqrt{15}$. Therefore, the legs of the right triangles measure $\\sqrt{15}$. Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuses, or the smaller square's sides. We have Squaring this, the area of the smaller square is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 30 }$."

The remaining blue triangles cannot be matched with other blue triangles since that would mean there were more than $3$ blue pairs, so the remaining blue triangles must be paired with white triangles, yielding $4$ blue-white pairs, one for each of the remaining blue triangles. This uses $2$ blue triangles and $2$ white triangles on each side, leaving $5$ white triangles apiece, which must be paired with each other, so there are $5$ white-white pairs, $\\boxed{\\text{B}}$."

      "The number $0$ has no reciprocal, and $1$ and $-1$ are their own reciprocals. This leaves only $2$ and $-2$. The reciprocal of $2$ is $1/2$, but $2$ is not less than $1/2$. The reciprocal of $-2$ is $-1/2$, and $-2$ is less than $-1/2$, so it is $\\boxed{A}$.The statement \"a number is less than its reciprocal\" can be translated as $x < \\frac{1}{x}$.Multiplication by $x$ can be done if you do it in three parts: $x>0$, $x=0$, and $x<0$. You have to be careful about the direction of the inequality, as you do not know the sign of $x$.If $x>0$, the sign of the inequality remains the same. Thus, we have $x^2 < 1$ when $x > 0$. This leads to $0 < x < 1$.If $x=0$, the inequality $x < \\frac{1}{x}$ is undefined.If $x<0$, the sign of the inequality must be switched. Thus, we have $x^2 > 1$ when $x < 0$. This leads to $x < -1$.Putting the solutions together, we have $x<-1$ or $0 < x < 1$, or in interval notation, $(-\\infty, -1) \\cup(0, 1)$. The only answer in that range is $\\boxed {\\text{(A)}\\ -2}$Starting again with $x < \\frac{1}{x}$, we avoid multiplication by $x$. Instead, move everything to the left, and find a common denominator:$x < \\frac{1}{x}$$x - \\frac{1}{x} < 0$$\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x} < 0$$\\frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x} < 0$Divide this expression at $x=-1$, $x=0$, and $x=1$, as those are the three points where the expression on the left will \"change sign\".If $x<-1$, all three of those terms will be negative, and the inequality is true. Therefore, $(-\\infty, -1)$ is part of our solution set.If $-1 < x < 0$, the $(x+1)$ term will become positive, but the other two terms remain negative. Thus, there are no solutions in this region.If $0 < x < 1$, then both $(x+1)$ and $x$ are positive, while $(x-1)$ remains negative. Thus, the entire region $(0, 1)$ is part of the solution set.If $1 < x$, then all three terms are positive, and there are no solutions.At all three \"boundary points\", the function is either $0$ or undefined. Therefore, the entire solution set is $(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (0, 1)$, and the only option in that region is $x=-2$, leading to $\\boxed{A}$.",

      "First consider the area of the two figures. Assume that the pegs are $1$ unit apart. Divide region I into two triangles by drawing a horizontal line on the second row from the top. Shifting the bottom triangle up one unit will create a square, and this square has the same area as region I. Thus, region I has an area of $1$ square unit.Draw a horizontal line on figure II on the fourth row from the top to divide the figure into two triangles. Temporarily move the top of the higher triangle one peg to the left. This will preserve the area of the triangle, as you are keeping both the height and the base of the triangle equal. Now you have two congruent triangles that are half of the area of a unit square. Thus, region II also has an area of $1$ square unit, and the areas are equal.To compare the perimeters, note that region I has two different side lengths: two sides are $1$ unit apart, and the other two sides are $\\sqrt{2}$ apart, as they are the diagonal of a unit square. The total perimeter is $2 + 2\\sqrt{2}$.Note that region II has three different side lengths. One side is a unit length, while two sides are $\\sqrt{2}$. For the perimeters to be equal, the last side must be of unit length. But the last side in region II is clearly longer than $1$ unit, so we can say that the perimeter of region II is greater than the perimeter of region I without calculating it.Thus, the correct answer is $\\boxed{E}$.(The perimeter of region II is $1 + 2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{5}$, since the last side is the diagonal of a 2 by 1 rectangle, and can be found with the pythagorean theorem as $\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5}$. This does not need to be found for this problem, as you can do a one-to-one correspondence with three of the four sides of the figure as outlined, and just compare the last remaining side of each figure.)",

Since $\\sqrt{5}$ > 1, the perimeter of II is greater, therefore the correct answer is $\\boxed{E}$."

If you had more than $1$ penny, you must have at least $6$ pennies to leave a multiple of $5$ for the nickels, dimes, and quarters. But you only have $5$ more coins to assign.Now you have $61 - 1 = 60$ cents remaining for $4$ coins, which may be nickels, quarters, or dimes. If you have only one more dime, that leaves $50$ cents in $3$ nickels or quarters, which is impossible. If you have two dimes, that leaves $40$ cents for $2$ nickels or quarters, which is again impossible. If you have three dimes, that leaves $30$ cents for $1$ nickel or quarter, which is still impossible. And all four remaining coins being dimes will not be enough.Therefore, you must have no more dimes to assign, and the $60$ cents in $4$ coins must be divided between the quarters and nickels. We quickly see that $2$ nickels and $2$ quarters work. Thus, the total count is $2$ quarters, $2$ nickels, $1$ penny, plus one more coin of each type that we originally subtracted. Double-checking, that gives a total $2 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 9$ coins, and a total of $2\\cdot 25 + 2\\cdot 5 + 1 + (1 + 5 + 10 + 25) = 102$ cents.There is only $1$ dime in that combo, so the answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",

      "It is clear that there should only be $2$ pennies; any more would take up too many coins, and the limit is $9$. Now we have $ $1$ left, and $7$ coins to use. Looking at the quarters, we can make methodical guesses. If there is $1$ quarter, then we would have to make $ $0.75$ with $6$ coins. We take a few educated guesses for the nickel and dime combos, and see that $1$ quarter will not work. Trying values for $2$ quarters, we see that this will not work either. When we reach $3$ quarters, the remaining is $ $0.25$ made from $4$ coins. We try with $2$ dimes, which does not work (it only takes $3$ coins) and we try with $1$ dime. After trying $2$ pennies, $3$ quarters, $1$ dime, and $3$ nickels, it is evident that this combo works. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{A}$~mk"

In this case, no matter where you add the letters, there will be $5 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 14$ letters in total. If you divide them as evenly as possible among the three groups, you get $5, 5, 4$, which is a possible situation.As before, the answer is $5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 - 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 40$, and the correct choice is $\\boxed{D}$Before new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third.

If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 5=100$ plates can be made. None of the other four ways to place the two letters will create as many plates.

Notice each number on the right end of each row is a perfect square. The perfect square closest to these is $121$ so $122$ is the first number on the next row.

      "While this may not be the best, most efficient way to solve this problem, it can prove to be quite useful in similar problems. Using Calculus, we can use tangent-line approximation to approximate these square roots. First, we understand that these roots are of the form $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}.$ Given the values to approximate, 8, and 80, we find the closest square number to them, namely, 9, and 81.Now, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ to get $f'(x) = \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}.$ We can approximate $f(x)$, to get $f(x) \\approxeq f(x) + f`(x) \\cdot \\Delta{x},$ where $x$ is the perfect square closest to the the input value (in this case 8), and $\\Delta{x}$ is the difference between $x$ and the input value.The two cases are as follows:\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} input & x\\text{ }value & \\Delta{x} \\\\ \\hline 8 & 9 & 8-9=-1 \\\\ \\hline 80 & 81 & 80-81=-1 \\\\ \\end{array}Now, we can plug in our values into the equation, getting:\\begin{align*} &f(8) \\approxeq f(9) + f`(9) \\cdot -1 \\implies \\sqrt{9} + \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{9}} \\cdot -1 \\implies 3 - \\dfrac{1}{6} \\\\ &f(80) \\approxeq f(81) + f`(81) \\cdot -1 \\implies\\sqrt{81} + \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{81}} \\cdot -1 \\implies 9 - \\dfrac{1}{18} \\\\ \\end{align*}Thus, we see that our answer lies in the amount of whole numbers between $3 - \\dfrac{1}{6},$ and $9 - \\dfrac{1}{18},$ and as we are counting whole numbers, we can round each expression to narrow our interval to $[3,8].$ Therefore, we see that our answer is $\\boxed{6\\text{ }(B)}.$Note: this solution is definitely not the fastest solution, and in a competition, you should probably use intuition to see the closest numbers in the interval of those square roots, and solve the problem from there. ~Cheetahboy93"

      "This is a very common type of counting problem that you'll see quite often. Doing this the simple way would take too long, and might even make lots of mistakes.If you've ever learned about complementary counting, this would be the best time to utilize it. Instead of counting how many DO have 2's, why don't we count how many that DON'T?So let's find the number of numbers. Obviously, we'd start by subtracting 100 from 400, getting us 300, but we're not done. Since just subtracting includes the number 400, we must subtract one (because 400 isn't allowed - it says between), getting us 299.So how many numbers are there that DON'T have a 2? Well, we have 2 possibilities for the hundreds digit (1, 3, note that 2 is not allowed), 9 possibilities for the tens digit (1, 3, 4, 5,..., 9, 0), and 9 possibilities for the ones digit. $2 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 162$. However, one of the numbers we counted is $100$, which isn't allowed, so there are $162-1=161$ numbers without a 2.Since there are 299 numbers in total and 161 that DON'T have any 2's, $299 - 161 = 138$ numbers WILL have at least one two.$\\boxed{\\text{C}}$"

Thus the answer is $1+8+64+10=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }83}$.",
      "We begin by finding the inverse of the function that the machine uses. Call the input $I$ and the output $O$. If $I$ is even, $O=\\frac{I}{2}$, and if $I$ is odd, $O=3I+1$. We can therefore see that $I=2O$ when $I$ is even and $I=\\frac{O-1}{3}$ when $I$ is odd. Therefore, starting with $1$, if $I$ is even, $I=2$, and if $I$ is odd, $I=0$, but the latter is not valid since $0$ is not actually odd. This means that the 2nd-to-last number in the sequence has to be $2$. Now, substituting $2$ into the inverse formulae, if $I$ is even, $I=4$ (which is indeed even), and if $I$ is odd, $I=\\frac{1}{3}$, which is not an integer. This means the 3rd-to-last number in the sequence has to be $4$. Substituting in $4$, if $I$ is even, $I=8$, but if $I$ is odd, $I=1$. Both of these are valid solutions, so the 4th-to-last number can be either $1$ or $8$. If it is $1$, then by the argument we have just made, the 5th-to-last number has to be $2$, the 6th-to-last number has to be $4$, and the 7th-to-last number, which is the first number, must be either $1$ or $8$. In this way, we have ultimately found two solutions: $N=1$ and $N=8$.On the other hand, if the 4th-to-last number is $8$, substituting $8$ into the inverse formulae shows that the 5th-to-last number is either $16$ or $\\frac{7}{3}$, but the latter is not an integer. Substituting $16$ shows that if $I$ is even, $I=32$, but if I is odd, $I=5$, and both of these are valid. If the 6th-to-last number is $32$, then the first number must be $64$, since $\\frac{31}{3}$ is not an integer; if the 6th-to-last number is $5,$ then the first number has to be $10$, as $\\frac{4}{3}$ is not an integer.

They could have hopped straight from the 1st, done a double from #2, or used a single step from #3. The ways to get to each of these steps are $1+2+4=7$ ways to get to step 4. The pattern can then be extended: $4$ steps: $1+2+4=7$ ways. $5$ steps: $2+4+7=13$ ways. $6$ steps: $4+7+13=24$ ways.Thus, there are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 24}$ ways to get to step $6.$",
      "We first start by doing some simple casework to try and find the number of ways we can get to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Stairs. The number of ways to climb one stair is $1$. There are $2$ ways to climb two stairs: $1$, $1$ or $2$. For 3 stairs, there are $4$ ways: ( $1$, $1$, $1$ ) ( $1$, $2$ ) ( $2$, $1$ ) ( $3$ )Next we must try to generalize a recursive function to find the number of ways to climb the stairs. We start out with $f(n)$, which denotes the number of ways to climb the stairs. Then we must realize, To reach the nth stair, Jeff must take a 1 step from the $f(n-1)$ th stair, a double step from the $f(n-2)$ th stair, or a triple step from the $f(n-3)$ th stair. Therefore, the number of ways of reaching the nth step is the number of ways of reaching the $f(n-1)$ th plus the number of ways of reaching the $f(n-2)$ th plus the number of ways of reaching the $f(n-3)$ th. stair. So we have our generalized recursive function:Now that we have the function and a few of the values we can try to find $f(6)$Thus there are 24 ways to get to the 6th stair so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 24}$~ algebraic_algorithmichttps://youtu.be/5UojVH4Cqqs?t=4560~ pi_is_3.14",

      "Note that the units digits of the powers of 9 have a pattern: $9^1 = {\\bf 9}$, $9^2 = 8{\\bf 1}$, $9^3 = 72{\\bf 9}$, $9^4 = 656{\\bf 1}$, and so on. Since all natural numbers with the same last digit have the same remainder when divided by 5, the entire number doesn't matter, just the last digit. For even powers of $9$, the number ends in a $1$. Since the exponent is even, the final digit is $1$. Note that all natural numbers that end in $1$ have a remainder of $1$ when divided by $5$. So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}\\ 1}$.",
      "Write $1999$ as $2000-1$. We are taking $(2000-1)^{2000} \\mod{10}$. Using the binomial theorem, we see that ALL terms in this expansion are divisible by $2000$, which is in turn divisible by $5$, except for the very last term, which is just $(-1)^{2000}$. This is clear because the binomial expansion is just choosing how many $2000$ s and how many $-1$ s there are for each term. Using this, we can take the entire polynomial $\\mod{10}$, which leaves just $(-1)^{2000}=\\boxed{\\text{(B)}\\ 1}$.",
      "As $1999 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{5}$, we have $1999^{2000} \\equiv (-1)^{2000} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}\\ 1}$.",
      "A sum/product of any two natural numbers has the same remainder, when divided by $5$, as the sum/product of their remainders. Thus, we can use the basic definition of an exponent and view the problem as $1999 \\cdot 1999 \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot 1999$.Using the fact stated in the first sentence, we see that the remainder of $1999$, when divided by $5$, is $4$. The problem can now be written viewed as finding the remainder of $4^{2000}$ when it is divided by $5$, which is already much simpler.Now, toying with the simplified problem a little, see notice that powers of $4$ alternate from ending in $4$ and $6$. We notice that even powers of $4$ always end in $6$, and also that $2000$ is even. Thus $4^{2000}$ must end in $6$, which, when divided by $5$ gives a remainder of $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}\\ 1}$."

    "problem": "A \"stair-step\" figure is made of alternating black and white squares in each row. Rows $1$ through $4$ are shown. All rows begin and end with a white square. The number of black squares in the $37\\text{th}$ row is",

      "The best way to solve this problem is to find patterns and to utilize them to our advantage. For example, we can't really do anything without knowing how many squares there are in the 37th row. But who wants to continue the diagram for 37 rows? And what if the problem said 100,000th row? It'll still be possible - but not if your method is to continue the diagram...So hopefully there's a pattern. We find a pattern by noticing what is changing from row 1 to row 2. Basically, for the next row, we are just adding 2 squares (1 on each side) to the number of squares we had in the previous row. So each time we're adding 2. So how can we find $N$, if $N$ is the number of squares in the $a^\\text{th}$ row of this diagram? We can't just say that $N = 1 + 2a$, because it doesn't work for the first row. But since 1 is the first term, we have to EXCLUDE the first term, meaning that we must subtract 1 from a. Thus, $N = 1 + 2\\times(a - 1) = 2a - 1$. So in the 37th row we will have $2 \\times 37 - 1 = 74 - 1 = 73$.You may now be thinking - aha, we're finished. But we're only half finished. We still need to find how many black squares there are in these 73 squares. Well let's see - they alternate white-black-white-black... but we can't divide by two - there aren't exactly as many white squares as black squares... there's always 1 more white square... aha! If we subtract 1 from the number of squares (1 white square), we will have exactly 2 times the number of black squares.Thus, the number of black squares is $\\frac{73 - 1}{2} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36$36 is $\\boxed{\\text{C}}$",
      "Note that each row adds one black and one white square to the end of the previous one, and then shifts the new row over a little. Since the first row had no black squares, the number of black squares in any row is one less than the row number.Now that this has been established, we just have $37-1=36\\rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{C}}$",
      "We can easily spot the pattern. In the first row, there are $0$ black squares. In the second row, there is $1$ black square. So the pattern is that in order to find the number of black squares in a row, you need to subtract $1$ from the row number. Therefore, the number of black squares in the $37\\text{th}$ row we subtract 1. $37-1=36\\rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{C}}$~sakshamsethi"
