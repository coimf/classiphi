This is because, since $7$ is the largest element, when we take an alternating sum, each number in $S$ ends up with the opposite sign of each corresponding element of $S\\cup \\{7\\}$.Because there are $2^{6}=64$ of these pairs of sets, the sum of all possible subsets of our given set is $64 \\cdot 7$, giving an answer of $\\boxed{448}$.Consider a given subset $T$ of $S$ that contains $7$ ; then there is a subset $T'$ which contains all the elements of $T$ except for $7$, and only those elements. Since each element of $T'$ has one fewer element preceding it than it does in $T$, their signs are opposite. Thus the sum of the alternating sums of $T$ and $T'$ is equal to 7. There are $2^6$ subsets containing 7, so our answer is $7 \\cdot 2^6 = \\boxed{448}$.Denote the desired total of all alternating sums of an $n$ -element set as $S_n$. We are looking for $S_7$. Notice that all alternating sums of an $n$ -element set are also alternating sums of an $n+1$ -element set. However, when we go from an $n$ to $n+1$ element set, for each subset with the new element, we are adding the new element and subtracting one of the alternating sums of the $n$ -element set. There are $2^n$ subsets of an $n+1$ -element set that includes the new element, giving us the relationship $S_{n+1} = S_n + 2^n(n+1) - S_n = 2^n(n+1)$. When $n = 6$, we therefore get $S_ 7 = 2^6(7) = \\boxed{448}$.We analyze all the numbers from 1 to 7 separately to see where the number contributes its positive or negative to the sum of the alternating sums. Whenever 7 appears, which it does 64 times, it contributes a positive because it is always first. This gives a net gain of $7 \\cdot 64=448$.If we look at when 6 appears, which it also does 64 times, whether it comes as positive or negative depends on the presence of 7. Half of the subsets with 6 have 7 resulting in subtracting 6 each time, while the other half does not have 7 adding 6 each time, so these contributions of sixes cancel each other out giving a net gain of 0.The same thing happens to any positive integer less than 7. This is because the determination of a positive or negative contribution is dependent on the number of larger numbers in front of it(For example, the sign of 3 is dependent on the presence of 4, 5, 6, and 7 in the subset). If the number of larger numbers is even, it gives in a positive copy while odd produces its negative. We know that the frequencies of these two cases occurring are the same because $0=(1-1)^{n}=\\binom{n}{0}-\\binom{n}{1}+\\binom{n}{2}-...\\binom{n}{n}$ via the Binomial Theorem.

Similarly, let $t_{i}$ denote the probability that we get $2$ tails before $5$ heads, given that we have $i$ consecutive tails. Specifically, $h_{5} = 0$ and $t_{2} = 1$. If we can solve for $h_{1}$ and $t_{1}$, we are done; the answer is simply $1/2 * (h_{1} + t_{1})$, since on our first roll, we have equal chances of getting a string with \"1 consecutive head\" or \"1 consecutive tail.\"Consider solving for $t_{1}$. If we have 1 consecutive tail, then (a) rolling a head gets us to 1 consecutive head and (b) rolling a tail gets us to 2 consecutive tails. So, we must have:Applying similar logic, we get the equations:\\begin{align*} h_{1} &= \\frac{1}{2} h_{2} + \\frac{1}{2} t_{1}\\\\ h_{2} &= \\frac{1}{2} h_{3} + \\frac{1}{2} t_{1}\\\\ h_{3} &= \\frac{1}{2} h_{4} + \\frac{1}{2} t_{1}\\\\ h_{4} &= \\frac{1}{2} h_{5} + \\frac{1}{2} t_{1} \\end{align*}Since $h_{5} = 0$, we get $h_{4} = \\frac{1}{2} t_{1}$ $\\Rightarrow h_{3} = \\frac{3}{4} t_{1}$ $\\Rightarrow h_{2} = \\frac{7}{8} t_{1}$ $\\Rightarrow h_{1} = \\frac{15}{16} t_{1}$ $\\Rightarrow t_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} t_{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{15}{16} t_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{15}{32} t_{1} \\Rightarrow t_{1} = \\frac{16}{17}$ $\\Rightarrow h_{1} = \\frac{15}{16} \\cdot \\frac{16}{17} = \\frac{15}{17}$.So, the probability of reaching $2$ tails before $5$ heads is $\\frac{1}{2} (h_{1} + t_{1}) = \\frac{31}{34}$ ; we want the complement, $\\frac{3}{34}$, yielding an answer of $3 + 34 = \\boxed{037}$.Note: The same approach still works if we tried solving the original problem rather than the complement; we would have simply used $h_{5} = 1$ and $t_{2} = 0$ instead.

This writeup will be extremely lengthy because I am assuming just very basic concepts of linear algebra. The concepts here extend to higher levels of mathematics, so feel free to explore more in depth so that you can end up solving almost any variation of this classic problem.There are a possible of 3 states for this problem, so we can model the problem as a stochastic process. The resulting process has a transition matrix of:\\[\\hat{T} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0.5 & 0.5\\\\ 0.5 & 0 & 0.5\\\\ 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\]We aim to diagonalize this transition matrix to make it easier to exponentiate by converting it into what's known as it's Jordan Canonical Form.In order to do this, we must extract the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix. The eigenpolynomial for this matrix is obtained by calculating this matrix's determinant with $0-\\lambda$ about it's main diagonal like so:\n\n\\[\\hat{T}_{\\lambda} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0-\\lambda & 0.5 & 0.5\\\\ 0.5 & 0-\\lambda & 0.5\\\\ 0.5 & 0.5 & 0-\\lambda \\end{bmatrix}\\]We have the matrix's eigenpolynomial to be $\\lambda^3 - \\frac{3\\lambda}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$, and extracting eigenvalues by setting the polynomial equal to $0$, we have 2 eigenvalues: $\\lambda_1 = 1$ of multiplicity 1, and $\\lambda_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}$ of multiplicity 2. To extract the eigenvectors, we must assess the kernel of this matrix (also known as the null space), or the linear subspace of the domain of $\\hat{T}$ where everything gets mapped to the null vector.We first do this for $\\lambda_1$. Taking $-\\lambda_1$ across the diagonals to get $\\hat{T}_{\\lambda_1} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0.5 & 0.5\\\\ 0.5 & -1 & 0.5\\\\ 0.5 & 0.5 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$, we first reduce it to reduced row echelon form, which is $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1\\\\ 0 & 1 & -1\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. From here, we compute the kernel by setting\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1\\\\ 0 & 1 & -1\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\\\ x_2\\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} = 0\\]\n\n. So if we take our free variable $x_3 = 0 = t$, then that means that in the same fashion, $x_1 - x_1 = x_2 - x_2 = 0 = t$, so hence, the kernel of $\\hat{T}_{\\lambda} = \\begin{bmatrix} t\\\\ t\\\\ t \\end{bmatrix}$, or more simply, $t\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. $\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_1$. We do the same computations for our second unique eigenvalue, but I will save the computation to you. There are actually 2 eigenvectors for $\\lambda_2$, because the reduced row echelon form for $\\hat{T}_{\\lambda_2}$ has 2 free variables instead of 1, so our eigenvectors for $\\lambda_2$ are $\\begin{bmatrix} -1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. We are now ready to begin finding the Jordan canonical formIn linear algebra, the JCF (which also goes by the name of Jordan Normal Form) is an upper triangular matrix representing a linear transformation over a finite-dimensional complex vector space. Any square matrix that has a Jordan Canonical Form has its field of coefficients extended into a field containing all it's eigenvalues. You can find more information about them on google, as well as exactly how to find them but for now let's get on with the problem. I will skip the computation in this step, largley because this writeup is already gargantuan for a simple AIME problem, and because there are countless resources explaining how to do so.We aim to decompose $\\hat{T}$ into the form $\\hat{T} = SJS^{-1}$, where $S$ is a matrix whose columns consist of the eigenvectors of $\\hat{T}$, $J$ is the Jordan matrix, and $S^{-1}$ is, well, the inverse of $S$. We have 1 eigenvalue of multiplicity 1, and 1 of multiplicity 2, so based on this info, we set our eigenvalues along the diagonals like so.\nWe have:\n\n\\[J = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, S = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, S^{-1} = \\frac{1}{3}\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 & 2\\\\ -1 & 2 & -1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nand so:\n\n\\[\\hat{T} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0.5 & 0.5\\\\ 0.5 & 0 & 0.5\\\\ 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = SJS^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{3} & -\\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{2}{3}\\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{2}{3} & -\\frac{1}{3}\\\\ \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nNow that we have converted to Jordan Canonical Form, it is extremely easy to compute $\\hat{T}^n$.It is an important fact that for any matrix $K$ with Jordan decomposition $SJ_kS^{-1}$, we have that $K^n = S(J_k)^nS^{-1}$\nUsing this fact, we aim to find the general solution for the problem.\n$J^n = \\begin{bmatrix} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, and using the laws of matrix multiplication,\n\n\\[SJ^n = \\begin{bmatrix} (-1)^{n+1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n & (-1)^{n+1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n & 1\\\\ 0 & \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n & 1\\\\ \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nSo finally, our final, generalized transition matrix after any number of steps $n$ is:\n\n\\[\\hat{T}^n = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^{1+n}(2)^{1-n} & \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)} & \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)}\\\\ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)} & \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^{1+n}(2)^{1-n} & \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)}\\\\ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)} & \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)} & \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^{1+n}(2)^{1-n} \\end{bmatrix}\\]For the sake of this problem, we seek the top left element, which is $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^{1+n}(2)^{1-n}$. Substituting $n=10$ readily gives the probability of the bug reaching it's starting position within 10 moves to be $\\frac{171}{512} \\implies m+n = \\boxed{683}$And we have also derived formulae for the bug reaching any state within $n$ moves as a byproduct!~RedFlame2112This method does not rigorously get the answer, but it works. As the bug makes more and more moves, the probability of it going back to the origin approaches closer and closer to 1/3. Therefore, after 10 moves, the probability gets close to $341.33/1024$. We can either round up or down. If we round down, we see $341/1024$ cannot be reduced any further and because the only answers on the AIME are below 1000, this cannot be the right answer. However, if we round up, $342/1024$ can be reduced to $171/512$ where the sum 171+512= $\\boxed{683}$ is an accepted answer.The generating function for this is $(x+x^2)$ since an ant on any vertex of the equilateral triangle can go $120$ degrees or $240$ degrees to a side and simplifying $(x^{120}+x^{240})$ gets you $(x+x^2)$. Since $360$ degrees brings you back to the original vertex then we must find the sum of the coefficients that share a variable with a power divisible by $3$.Since we take this rotation $10$ times, our function becomes $(x+x^2)^{10}$ which is the same as $x^{10}(x+1)^{10}$. This completely simplified is $x(x+1)^{10}$ and since your maximum power is $11$, we only have to find the coefficients for $3$, $6$, and $9$ ( $0$ would apply here but the $x$ is the lowest power there is).For $x^9$, the coefficient is ${10 \\choose 2}$, and the same goes for $x^3$. For $x^6$, the coefficient is ${10 \\choose 5}$ and the final sum for the numerator is $2*{10 \\choose 2} + {10 \\choose 5}$. The total sum is $90+252=342$ and for the denominator, it was simply $2^{10}$ and this simplified was $171/512$. Therefore the sum is $683$.Start of with any vertex, say $A$. Denote $a_n$ the number of paths ending where it started. Then notice that for a path to end in the vertex you started on, you must have for the $(n-1)$ case that of the $2^{n-1}$ total paths, we must take away the paths that end in the $(n-1)$ -st term where it started off. (Because imagine on the $(n-1)$ move that it landed on vertex $A$. Then if we wanted to find the number of length $n$ paths that end at $A$, we would be able to find that path, because on the $(n-1)$ -st move it landed at $A$. You can't go from $A$ to $A$ ). Hence we have the recursion $a_n=2^{n-1}-a_{n-1}$, with $a_3 = 2$. Now reiterating gives us $a_{10} = 342$, so that the probability is $\\frac{342}{2^{10}} = \\frac{171}{512}$. So we have $171 + 512 = \\boxed{683}$.\n~th1nq3r(Note: One might be confused because you might think maybe \"But we only did it for case $A$. Now for $B$ and $C$. Oh wait they are symmetric. So then if this is the correct answer, why am I wrong, or what happened to that factor of $3$?\" Well truth be told, I skipped a somewhat major step. Notice that the total amount $2^n$ only comes from if we START OFF at vertex $A$. So we really need to multiply $2^n$ by $3$ to get $3(2^n)$ as the TRUE total amount. However this factor of $3$ doesn't matter because now that we do case work, let $a_n$ once again denote the number of paths starting at vertex $A$. Then abusing symmetry, we have that the number of paths ending where it started as $3(a_n)=3(2^{n-1}-a_{n-1})$. So now when we take the probability, we cancel the factor of $3$, and obtain the same answer as if it were for all three vertices)."]}, "2003_aime_ii_problems/problem_3": {"id": {"year": 2003, "contest_name": "AIME II", "problem_number": 3}, "title": "2003 AIME II Problems/Problem 3", "problem": "Define a $\\text{good~word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ - some of these letters may not appear in the sequence - and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$.

Then, we must consider three cases.On the plane, points $B$ and $C$ are taken. The ant that moves to $D$ can come from either $E$ or $C$. The ant that moves to $E$ can come from either $B$ or $D$. Once these two ants are fixed, the other two ants must migrate to the \"poles\" of the octahedron, points $A$ and $F$. Thus, there are two degrees of freedom in deciding which ant moves to $D$, two degrees of freedom in deciding which ant moves to $E$, and two degrees of freedom in deciding which ant moves to $A$. Hence, there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2=8$ ways the ants can move to different points.On the plane, points $B$ and $D$ are taken. The ant that moves to $C$ must be from $B$ or $D$, but the ant that moves to $E$ must also be from $B$ or $D$. The other two ants, originating from points $C$ and $E$, must move to the poles.

We oriented the square so that point $B$ was defined as the point to which the ant from point $A$ moved. Since the ant from point $A$ can actually move to four different points, there is a total of $4 \\times 20=80$ ways the ants can move to different points.Each ant acts independently, having four different points to choose from. Hence, each ant has probability $1/4$ of moving to the desired location. Since there are six ants, the probability of each case occuring is $\\frac{1}{4^6} = \\frac{1}{4096}$.

For example, $f(3)$ would represent the number of ways in which an ant could navigate $2$ vertices and then return back to the original spot. Since an ant cannot stay still, $f(1) = 0$. We also easily see that $f(2) = 1, f(3) = 2$.Now consider any four vertices of the octahedron. All four vertices will be connected by edges except for one pair. Let\u2019s think of this as a square with one diagonal (from top left to bottom right). EDIT: This part is wrong as if you choose the 4 vertices that have a cross section as a square, there exists no connecting diagonal.Suppose an ant moved across this diagonal; then the ant at the other end can only move across the diagonal (which creates 2-cycle, bad) or it can move to another vertex, but then the ant at that vertex must move to the spot of the original ant (which creates 3-cycle, bad). Thus none of the ants can navigate the diagonal and can either shift clockwise or counterclockwise, and so $f(4) = 2$.For $f(6)$, consider an ant at the top of the octahedron. It has four choices. Afterwards, it can either travel directly to the bottom, and then it has $2$ ways back up, or it can travel along the sides and then go to the bottom, of which simple counting gives us $6$ ways back up. Hence, this totals $4 \\times (2+6) = 32$.Now, the number of possible ways is given by the sum of all possible cycles,\n\n\\[a \\cdot f(2) \\cdot f(2) \\cdot f(2) + b \\cdot f(2) \\cdot f(4) + c \\cdot f(3) \\cdot f(3) + d \\cdot f(6)\\]where the coefficients represent the number of ways we can configure these cycles. To find $a$, fix any face, there are $4$ adjacent faces to select from to complete the cycle. From the four remaining faces there are only $2$ ways to create cycles, hence $a = 8$.To find $b$, each cycle of $2$ faces is distinguished by their common edge, and there are $12$ edges, so $b = 12$.To find $c$, each three-cycle is distinguished by the vertex, and there are $8$ edges. However, since the two three-cycles are indistinguishable, $c = 8/2 = 4$.Clearly $d = 1$. Finally,\\[8(1)(1)(1) + 12(1)(2) + 4(2)(2) + (32) = 80\\]Each bug has $4$ possibilities to choose from, so the probability is $\\frac{80}{4^6} = \\frac{5}{256}$.", "We use the idea of cycles.Case 1: Two 3-cycles.\nWe have 4 ways to divide the faces into cycles. There are 8 faces, and once a face has been chosen, the other three vertices must form the other cycle of length 3. Then there are $2^2$ ways to choose the direction of the cycle. There are $4 \\cdot 4 = 16.$Case 2: Three 2-cycles.\nThere are $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ ways to do so.Case 3: One 4-cycle, one 2-cycle.\nThere are $12 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways here because there are 12 different edges for the 2-cycle and we can choose the direction of the 4-cycle.Case 4: One 6-cycle.\nVisualizing the octahedron as a 4-sided pyramid pointing up above one pointing down, we look at the ways an ant can start from the top vertex and visit all vertices without revisiting one along the way and returning to the top. Because the first step must be from the top to the middle square ring, we choose one vertex to move to and will multiply the final result by four.We divide the paths into two sub-cases.Sub-case 1: The ant continues to the bottom vertex. In this case, the ant has visited three corners of a square, but can not next visit the fourth corner or there will be no way to connect the remaining two vertices of the octahedron. Thus, the ant must next visit one of the other two vertices, and that selection decides the remainder of the path. Thus, this sub-case has 2 possible paths.Sub-case 2: The ant continues along the \"equator\" square ring. By symmetry, there are two choices. Choose one, and we will multiply the final result by two. From that second point on the equator, there are two choices. If it continues to a third point on the equator, there is only one path to complete the cycle. If it next moves to the bottom vertex, there are two ways to complete the cycle. This gives a total of three possible paths. Multiplying by 2 gives 6 for this sub-case.There are $(2 + 6) \\cdot 4 = 32$ ways here.Overall, there are $80$ cases. Answer is $80/2^{12} = 5/256$~Williamgolly + Dr. 17", "Let $ACEDFB$ be the octahedron such that points $CDEF$ are coplanar, $C/D$ are opposite each other and $E/F$ are opposite each other.The set of points that the ants from $A/B$ can travel to is $\\{C,D,E,F\\}$, the set of points that the ants from $C/D$ can travel to is $\\{A,B,E,F\\}$ and the set of points that the ants from $E/F$ can travel to is $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$. So the problem is analogous to finding the number of ways to take 2 elements from each of these sets to make the set $\\{A,B,C,D,E,F\\}$.If this occurs then the ants from $C/D$ must travel to $E/F$ and therefore the ants from $E/F$ must travel to $C/D$. So this gives 1 case.If this happens then one of the ants from $C/D$ must go to $B$ and one of the ants from $A/B$ must go to $D$ and the remaining ant from $C/D$ can choose to go to $E$ or $F$ and then the remaining ant from $A/B$ has only 1 choice. So this gives 2 cases.The ants from $E/F$ traveling to $A/B$ is equivalent to them traveling to $C/D$ (both remove 2 elements from another set). And the ants from $E/F$ traveling to $A/C$ is equivalent to them traveling to $A/D$ or $B/C$ or $B/D$ (both remove 1 element from the other 2 sets). Also, for each of the 3 pairs of ants there are 2 ways the pair of ants can go to 2 points (for example, $E\\mapsto A$ and $F\\mapsto B$ or $E\\mapsto B$ and $F\\mapsto A$ ) so there are $2^{3}(2\\cdot1 + 4\\cdot2) = 80$ possibilties.

We can find this by utilizing stars and bars, with the following marker being placed to represent groups: *| - *|*. Now, we have to place $12$ numbers within $3$ groups, which is ${14 \\choose 2}$. The same concept can be used for the remaining numbers. The rest of the solution continues as above.Solution by: Everyoneintexas", "We have the same setup as in the previous solution.Note that if $n < 2k - 1$, the answer will be 0. Otherwise, the $k$ elements we choose define $k + 1$ boxes (which divide the nonconsecutive numbers) into which we can drop the $n - k$ remaining elements, with the caveat that each of the middle $k - 1$ boxes must have at least one element (since the numbers are nonconsecutive). This is equivalent to dropping $n - 2k + 1$ elements into $k + 1$ boxes, where each box is allowed to be empty. And this is equivalent to arranging $n - k + 1$ objects, $k$ of which are dividers, which we can do in $F(n, k) = {n - k + 1 \\choose k}$ ways.Now, looking at our original question, we see that the thing we want to calculate is just $F(15, 1) + F(14, 2) + F(13, 3) + F(12, 4) + F(11, 5) = {15\\choose 1} + {13\\choose2} + {11\\choose 3} + {9\\choose 4} + {7 \\choose 5} = 15 + 78 + 165 + 126 + 21 = 405 \\Longrightarrow \\mathrm{(E)}$", "Let $s$ be the numbers of elements in a subset. First we examine the second condition. No elements less than $s$ can be put in a subset of size $s$, therefore the \"lowest\" element that can go into the subset is $s$, whereas the \"highest\" element that can go into the subset is $15$. This is a total of $15-s+1$ or $16-s$ possible elements.Now we consider the first condition. No consecutive elements are allowed. This means that if an element $e$ is put into the subset, both $e-1$ and $e+1$ are no longer possibilities. Assume that all subsets are ordered from least to greatest (we are looking for the number of combinations, so we can order these combinations however we want). Then the first element will be $s$ (as a reminder, the lowest possible element in a subset is $s$ ), the second element will be at least $s+2$, and so on. After $s$ elements are chosen, we will have skipped $s-1$ elements (these are the elements that were \"eliminated\" as they were consecutive). Therefore, we ignore exactly $s-1$ elements (if we ignore more or less elements, then $s$ changes) Since we must ignore $s-1$ elements, we can simply remove those beforehand. ( $16-s)-(s-1) = 17-2s$ possible elementsNow we look for the bounds of $s$. We are looking for non-empty subsets, so $s\\ge1$. If $s$ is too large, there will not be enough non-consecutive terms between $s$ and $15$. Specifically, the highest element in a subset using \"optimal\" selection will be $s+2(s-1)$ or $3s-2$. If $3s-1>15$, that means s is too large. Therefore $3s-2\\le15$ ; solving for $s$ yields $s\\le5$. Now we know that $1 \\le s \\le 5$.We want to know the number of ways to arrange $17-2s$ \"balls\" into $s$ identical \"boxes\" with at most $1$ ball per box, for $s=1$ to $s=5$. This is equivalent to $\\sum_{s=1}^{5}{17-2s \\choose s} = 405$, or $\\boxed{\\text{E}}$.", "We will split the problem into cases, and maybe one could then generalize this to arbitrary $n$.$\\bold{Case 1}:$ ( $n=15, k=1$ ). Then this is easy. We have $\\binom{15}{1}=15$.$\\bold{Case 2}:$ ( $n=14, k=2$ ). Now we have something tricky. To get a good grasp on this case, let us consider the smallest element; $2$, in the first spot. We then have $15-1=14$ numbers left. However, we cannot have the digit $3$. Hence we have to choose $2$ numbers from $14-1=13$ integers left. This can be done in $\\binom{13}{2}=78$ ways.$\\bold{Case 3}:$ ( $n=13, k=3$ ). As in the last case, we can use the smallest element to get a good grasp on this case. Put the digit $3$ in the first spot. Then there are $11$ integers left for the second spot. But in total, we have to avoid $2$ elements for each subset of cardinality $3$ ${a,b,c}$. So we have to choose $3$ elements from $13-2=11$ elements, which can be done in $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways.$\\bold{Case 4}:$ ( $n=12, k=4$ ). As in the previous case, we have to avoid $3$ numbers, and choose $4$ from them. Which is choosing $4$ elements from $12-3=9$ elements, which can be done in $\\binom{9}{4}=126$ ways.$\\bold{Case 5}:$ ( $n=11, k=4$ ). Now you are accustomed to the strategy. We remove $4$ integers leaving $\\binom{7}{5}=21$ ways.Adding up all of the cases yields $405$, as in $\\boxed{E)405}$.\nSHEN KISLAY KAI~~2023Note also that we only went up to cardinality or $k=5$, or else for greater $k$, we would always have consecutive numbers.EDIT: I have coincidentally found a video solution using the exact same method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqE9P2JEs-k\n(Also if you think I am copying, why would I have then posted the video, hm?

If $n = 2$, then black wins (since white can't move). If $n = 3$, then white wins (since white can move forward one space to corner black). Similarly, if $n = 4$, then white wins (since white can move forward two spaces to corner black).Additionally, note that if the first player decides to move backwards $i$ spaces, then the second player can move forwards $i$ spaces to maintain the number of spaces between the first player and the second player. Same goes for if the second player moves backwards. Thus, if the two pieces are adjacent to each other and it is the first player's turn, then the first player would lose because the second player can force the first player back to the end of the playing area (same for the second player).With this in mind, if $n = 5$, then black would win because moving one space forward would put white in black's position in $n = 4$ and moving two spaces would put white in black's position in $n = 3$. Additionally, if $n = 6$, then white would win because by moving one, white would force black in white's position in $n = 5$, and if $n = 7$, then white would win by moving two.Thus, we can suspect that black would win if $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ and white would in otherwise, and we can prove by induction. We already have the base case covered in the above paragraphs. For the inductive step, assume that black would win if $n = 3n+2$ and white would win in $n = 3n+3$ or $n = 3n+4$. Since white moves first, we can note that the second player moving would win if $n = 3n+2$ and the first player would win otherwise. For $n = 3n+5$, white moving forward one space means that black can move two spaces forward to put white at $n = 3n+2$, and white moving forward two spaces means that black can move one space forward to put white at $n = 3n+2$, so black (or the second player) would win. However, for $n = 3n+6$, white can move forward 1 to force black in white's position in $n = 3n+5$, and for $n = 3n+7$, white can move forward 2 to force black in white's position in $n = 3n+5$, so white would win in both scenarios.Since white and black can copy the opponent moving backward, moving backwards would not affect the results. Thus, by induction, black would win if $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ by moving forward 1 if white moves forward 2 and moving forward 2 if white moves forward 1, and white would win otherwise by moving forward 1 if $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ or by moving forward 2 if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and then moving forward 1 if black moves forward 2 and moving forward 2 if black moves forward 1."]}, "2007_aime_ii_problems/problem_1": {"id": {"year": 2007, "contest_name": "AIME II", "problem_number": 1}, "title": "2007 AIME II Problems/Problem 1", "problem": "A mathematical organization is producing a set of commemorative license plates.

Since each integer in the subset must be at least $3$ away from any other integer in the subset, the largest spacy subset contains $4$ elements.First, it is clear that there is $1$ spacy set with $0$ elements in it, the empty set. Next, there are $12$ spacy subsets with $1$ element in them, one for each integer $1$ through $12$.Now, let us consider the spacy subsets with $2$ elements in them. If the smaller integer is $1$, the larger integer is any of the $9$ integers from $4$ to $12$. If the smaller integer is $2$, the larger integer is any of the $8$ integers from $5$ to $12$. This continues, up to a smaller integer of $9$ and $1$ choice for the larger integer, $12$. This means that there are $9 + 8 + \\cdots + 1 = 45$ spacy subsets with $2$ elements.For spacy subsets with $3$ elements, we first consider the middle integer. The smallest such integer is $4$, and it allows for $1$ possible value for the smaller integer ( $1$ ) and possible $6$ values for the larger integer ( $7$ through $12$ ), for a total of $1 \\cdot 6 = 6$ possible subsets. The next middle integer, $5$, allows for $2$ smaller integers and $5$ larger integers, and this pattern continues up until the middle integer of $9$, which has $6$ values for the smaller integer and $1$ value for the larger integer. This means that there are $1 \\cdot 6 + 2 \\cdot 5 + \\cdots + 6 \\cdot 1 = 56$ spacy subsets with $3$ elements.Lastly, there are $3$ main categories for spacy subsets with $4$ elements, defined by the difference between their smallest and largest values. The difference ranges from $9$ to $11$. If it is $9$, there is only $1$ set of places to put the two middle values ( $n + 3$ and $n + 6$, where $n$ is the smallest value). Since there are $3$ possible sets of smallest and largest values, there are $1 \\cdot 3 = 3$ sets in this category. If the difference is $10$, there are now $3$ sets of places to put the two middle values ( $n + 3$ and $n + 6$ or $7$, and $n + 4$ and $n + 7$ ). There are $2$ possible sets of smallest and largest values, so there are $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$ sets in this category.

First, start off by representing each element of the chosen subset with a $1$, and every other element $0$. The possible states are as follows; if the restriction was broken previously or not. For the sake of not over counting, we let the former be its own state (call it \"C\"), and the latter will be split up into more states. The previous two digits can either be $00$, $10$, or $01$. If a previous digit doesn't exist, it is $0$ for obvious reasons. We know that we start off at state \" $00$ \". We have two options; include the first digit ( $1$ ) or not ( $0$ ). Thus, state $00$ transitions to state $01$ in $1$ case and state $00$ in $1$ case. State $01$ transitions to $10$ in $1$ case and the \"C\" state in $1$ case. State $10$ transitions to $00$ in $1$ case and state \"C\" in $1$ case. Since it doesn't matter where or how many times the restriction is broken for the subset to fail, state \"C\" can transition to itself in $2$ cases.Notice how this corresponds to a transition matrix of\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$.

The graph of $A$ and $B$ will look like this, with $A$ having only integral y-values and $B$ having only integral x-values:As both $A$ and $B$ consist of a bunch of line segments, the probability that $A = B$ is the \"length\" of the overlap between the segments of $A$ and $B$ divided by the total length of the segments of $B$.Looking at the graph, we see that $A$ and $B$ will overlap only when $B$ is an integer. Specifically, each region of overlap will begin when $\\sqrt{P(x)}\\ = k, 5 \\le x \\le 15$ has solutions for integral $k$ in the range of $A$, which consists of the integers $1-13$, and end when $A$ jumps up to its next y-value.Using the quadratic formula, we see that the start point of each of these overlapping segments will be the integral values of $\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{45 + 4k^2}}{2}$ for $k$ in the specified range, meaning $45 + 4k^2$ must be a perfect square. Plugging in all the possible values of $k$, we get $k = 1, 3, 11$, corresponding to start points of $x = 5, 6, 13$.

On the graph, the overlapping segments of $A$ and $B$ would be represented by the highlighted green segments below:Taking the difference between this second x-value and the start point for each of our start points $x = 5, 6, 13$ and summing them will give us the total length of these green segments.

In other words, it gives us a polynomial in terms of $k$ where we can plug in $k=6$ to get our answer.Well, if we want to find $P_k$ for a graph $G$, we should probably first draw the graph, right? We can first draw five vertices (without any edges) in the shape of a pentagon. After connecting the diagonals, we get a star. We attempt to shift the vertices around to simplify the graph, which we quickly realize is isomorphic (can be turned into) the five-cycle, or the pentagon.Finding $P_k$ on a graph with a cycle of length at most 3 is straightforward -- we first pick a vertex v. It has 0 colored (visited) neighbors, so we can color it in k ways. We then move on to the vertices adjacent to v, etc, and at the end we multiply all these together. For example, the chromatic polynomial of a triangle is $k(k-1)(k-2)$. However, cycles with length > 3 introduce ambiguity, and thus the above technique fails. Thus, we need to use the recursive formula $P_k(G) = P_k(G-e)-P_k(G*e)$, where $G-e$ represents removing e and $G*e$ represents contracting e, or collapsing the two endpoints of e into one. When we hit a graph where the longest cycle has length 3, we can use the first technique to quickly find $P_k$.After about four iterations of the algorithm, we get that the chromatic polynomial is $k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)^3 + k(k-1)(k-2)$.

If $a_4 = 63\\text{, then }a_5$ is either 0, 63, or some number greater than 63 (since it must be a multiple of $z$ ).", "Note that the only way for a $0$ to be produced at $a_n$ is if either $a_{n-1} = 0$ or $a_{n-2} = a_{n-3}$. Since the first one will eventually get to the first three assuming that there is no $a_{n-2} = a_{n-3}$ for any $n$, that is not possible because $a_1, a_2, a_3 >= 1$. Therefore, we need $a_{n - 2} = a_{n - 3}$.If $2$ consecutive numbers out of $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are equal, then those cases work( $a_1$ and $a_2$ or $a_2$ and $a_3$ $\\textbf{NOT}$ $a_1$ and $a_3$ ). This is simply $10 \\cdot 10 + 10 \\cdot 10 - 10 = 190$ by PIE.Now, note that if any of the first three numbers have difference of $1$, we have another working case. First, we calculate how many there are given exactly one of $a_1,a_2$ or $a_2,a_3$ have difference $1$. Given $3$ numbers such that the first $2$ have difference $1$, exactly $4$ permutations work(assuming the numbers are $x,y,$ and $z$ such that $|x-y| = 1$ ): $x,y,z$ ; $y,x,z$ ; $z,x,y$ ; and $z,y,x$. If the two consecutive numbers are $1$ and $2$, then the last number has $7$ possiblities: $4,5,6,\\cdots, 10$. This is symmetric for $9$ and $10$. If the consecutive numbers are $(2,3),\\cdots, (8,9)$, there are $6$ possibilities( $10$ minus the numbers themselves and the numbers directly above and below). Note that we are not counting any cases already counted in the first case. Therefore, this case gives you $4(7 + 6 * 7 + 7) = 224$. Now we consider the case that there both adjacent $a$ s have increments of $1$.\n\n\\[+1, +1 \\rightarrow 8\\]\n\n\n\\[-1, -1 \\rightarrow 8\\]\n\n\n\\[+1, -1 \\rightarrow 9\\]\n\n\n\\[-1, +1 \\rightarrow 9\\]\n\nTherefore this gives $224 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 9 = 258$. However, note that we have to add the case where you have $3$ consecutive numbers in arrangement such that only $2$ consecutive numbers have difference $1$. For example, $1,3,2$ is one such triple. There are $8$ triples of consecutive numbers and $4$ ways to arrange each one(e.x: $(1,3,2);(3,1,2);(2,1,3);(2,3,1)$ ). This adds on 32 working cases, so this case gives $258 + 32 = 290$.Note that there is an ultraspecial(Yes, I know that's not a word) case where we generate a pair of $a_i$ that have difference one. This can only happen if $a_3 = 1$ and $a_1$ and $a_2$ have difference $2$. This contributes $14$ cases( $2 * 8$ and then subtract $2$ because of the cases $3,1,1$ and $4,2,1$ ).Therefore, our answer is $190 + 290 + 14 = \\boxed{494}$.\nSolution by hyxue"]}, "2015_aime_ii_problems/problem_10": {"id": {"year": 2015, "contest_name": "AIME II", "problem_number": 10}, "title": "2015 AIME II Problems/Problem 10", "problem": "Call a permutation $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ of the integers $1, 2, \\ldots, n$ quasi-increasing if $a_k \\leq a_{k+1} + 2$ for each $1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$.

In the following, $1 <= a,b,c,d <= 6$ are distinct numbers. After determining the (unordered) numbers that can appear on the dice, we must determine how many ways we can order those dice rolls in sequence.Case1: The unordered numbers shown are {a,a,a,a} In this case, it is clear that the pairing (a,a) and (a,a) will yield equal sums, so we have 6 possible choices for a, and this is the number of possible rolls that take this form.Case2: The unordered numbers shown are {a,a,a,b} In this case, one of the pairs will contain b, hence the pairs will be (a,b) and (a,a). But these can never be equal as a 6= b.Case3: The unordered numbers shown are {a,a,b,b} To obtain equal sums, we must split the numbers into the pairs (a,b) and (a,b). There are $\\binom{6}{2}= 15$ ways to select a and b, and there are $\\binom{4}{2}= 6$ ways to order the rolls (select two of the rolls to be a\u2019s). Hence there are 15\u00b76 = 90 total rolls that take this form.Case4: The unordered numbers shown are {a,a,b,c} In this case, either b pairs with a or b pairs with c. If b pairs with a, then $a + b = c + a$, which is impossible as $b \\ne c$. Therefore, b must pair with c, so $2a = b + c$. Therefore, b + c is even. We may assume without loss of generality that $b <= c$, hence the possibilities for (b,c) are (b,c) = (1,3),(1,5),(2,4),(2,6),(3,5),(4,6).\nTherefore, there are six ways to choose (b,c), and a is automatically determined (it is the average of b and c). Then there are 4! 2! = 12 ways to order the rolls, hence there are $6\\cdot 12 = 72$ total rolls that take this form.Case5: The unordered numbers shown are {a,b,c,d} In this case, the sum of the pairs must be representable in at two ways with distinct integers.

In particular, for the numbers $5,6,8,9$,we know immediately what the four numbers a,b,c,d are. For 7,we must choose two of the three pairs, and we can do this in three ways. Therefore, the number of ways to choose {a,b,c,d} is $1+1+1+1+3 = 7$. Then we can order the rolls in 4! = 24 ways. Thus there are $7\\cdot 24 = 168$ total rolls that take this form.

We can do casework on the number of repeating digits that the multiple of $11$ has:$\\textbf{Case 1:}$ All three digits are the same.\nBy inspection, we find that there are no multiples of $11$ here.$\\textbf{Case 2:}$ Two of the digits are the same, and the third is different.$\\textbf{Case 2a:}$\nThere are $8$ multiples of $11$ without a zero that have this property:\n$121$, $242$, $363$, $484$, $616$, $737$, $858$, $979$.\nEach contributes $3$ valid permutations, so there are $8 \\cdot 3 = 24$ permutations in this subcase.$\\textbf{Case 2b:}$\nThere are $9$ multiples of $11$ with a zero that have this property:\n$110$, $220$, $330$, $440$, $550$, $660$, $770$, $880$, $990$.\nEach one contributes $2$ valid permutations (the first digit can't be zero), so there are $9 \\cdot 2 = 18$ permutations in this subcase.$\\textbf{Case 3:}$ All the digits are different.\nSince there are $\\frac{990-110}{11}+1 = 81$ multiples of $11$ between $100$ and $999$, there are $81-8-9 = 64$ multiples of $11$ remaining in this case. However, $8$ of them contain a zero, namely $209$, $308$, $407$, $506$, $605$, $704$, $803$, and $902$. Each of those multiples of $11$ contributes $2 \\cdot 2=4$ valid permutations, but we overcounted by a factor of $2$ ; every permutation of $209$, for example, is also a permutation of $902$. Therefore, there are $8 \\cdot 4 / 2 = 16$. Therefore, there are $64-8=56$ remaining multiples of $11$ without a $0$ in this case. Each one contributes $3! = 6$ valid permutations, but once again, we overcounted by a factor of $2$ (note that if a number ABC is a multiple of $11$, then so is CBA). Therefore, there are $56 \\cdot 6 / 2 = 168$ valid permutations in this subcase.Adding up all the permutations from all the cases, we have $24+18+16+168 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 226}$.", "We can first overcount and then subtract.\nWe know that there are $81$ multiples of $11$.We can then multiply by $6$ for each permutation of these multiples. (Yet some multiples do not have six distinct permutations.)Now divide by $2$, because if a number $abc$ with digits $a$, $b$, and $c$ is a multiple of $11$, then $cba$ is also a multiple of $11$ so we have counted the same permutations twice.Basically, each multiple of $11$ has its own $3$ permutations (say $abc$ has $abc$ $acb$ and $bac$ whereas $cba$ has $cba$ $cab$ and $bca$ ). We know that each multiple of $11$ has at least $3$ permutations because it cannot have $3$ repeating digits.Hence we have $243$ permutations without subtracting for overcounting.\nNow note that we overcounted cases in which we have $0$ 's at the start of each number. So, in theory, we could just answer $A$ and then move on.If we want to solve it, then we continue.We overcounted cases where the middle digit of the number is $0$ and the last digit is $0$.Note that we assigned each multiple of $11$ three permutations.The last digit is $0$ gives $9$ possibilities where we overcounted by $1$ permutation for each of $110, 220,..., 990$.The middle digit is $0$ gives $8$ possibilities where we overcount by $1$.\n$605, 704, 803, 902$ and $506, 407, 308, 209$Subtracting $17$ gives $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 226}$.Now, we may ask if there is further overlap (i.e if two of $abc$ and $bac$ and $acb$ were multiples of $11$ ). Thankfully, using divisibility rules, this can never happen, as taking the divisibility rule mod $11$ and adding, we get that $2a$, $2b$, or $2c$ is congruent to $0\\ (mod\\ 11)$. Since $a, b, c$ are digits, this can never happen as none of them can equal $11$ and they can't equal $0$ as they are the leading digit of a three-digit number in each of the cases.", "Taken from solution three, we notice that there are a total of $81$ multiples of $11$ between $100$ and $999$, and each of them have at most $6$ permutation (and thus is a permutations of $6$ numbers), giving us a maximum of $486$ valid numbers.However, if $abc$ can be divided by $11$, so can $cba$, which is distinct if $c \\neq a$. And if $c = a$ then $abc$ and $cba$ have the same permutations. Either way, we have doubled counted.\nThis reduces the number of permutations to $486/2 = 243$.Furthermore, if $a=b$ or $c=0$ (which turn out to be equivalent conditions! for example $220$ ), not all (inverse) permutations are distinct ( $\\mathbf{2}20 = 2\\mathbf{2}0$ ) or valid ( $022$ ). (There are 9 of these.)Similarly, for $a0b$, not all (inverse) permutations are valid. (There are 8 of these.)As long as you notice at least one example of one of these 3 cases, you may infer that the answer must be smaller than $243$.

Each of these sections has $10$ distinct sub-squares, whether partially or in full.

There is simply 1 way to do this: $0101010101010101010$.\nNow, we note that there cannot be only one block of $11$ in the entire sequence, as there must be zeroes at both ends and if we only include 1 block, of $11$ s this cannot be satisfied. This is true for all odd numbers of $11$ blocks.Case 2 : There are 2 $11$ blocks. Using the zeroes in the sequence as dividers, we have a sample as $0110110101010101010$.

For example, we can represent the string $01011010110110$ as: $0-10-110-10-110-110$.\nTo not have any consecutive 0s, we must have at least one $1$ before the next $0$. However, we cannot have three or more $1$ s before the next $0$ because we cannot have three consecutive $1$ s. Consequently, we can only have one or two $1$ s.So we can have the groups: $10$ and $110$.After the initial $0$, we have $18$ digits left to fill in the string.

There are $d(n,k+1)$ ways of arrangements.Thus, $f(n,k)=f(n,k+1)+d(n,k+1)$, i.e. $f(n,k+1)=f(n,k)-d(n,k+1)$, which is the first equation.2. If $1$ and $2$, $2$ and $3$,..., $k-1$ and $k$ aren't together, but $k$ and $k+1$ are together, there are 2 cases\u00a0:(a) $k-1$ isn't together with $k$ or $k+1$. We first determine the order of $k$ and $k+1$, then, we can treat them as one number since they should be always together. Hence, the number of arrangements is $2f(n-1,k)$.(b) $k-1$ is together with $k$ or $k+1$. We first determine the order of $k$ and $k+1$, then treat them as one \"super number\". Since $k-1$ is together with the \"super number\", there are $2d(n-1,k)$ ways of arrangements. However, $k-1$ can only be on one side of the \"super number\" because $k-1$ and $k$ aren't together, so we need to multiple a $1/2$ to the number of arrangements. Finally, there are $2d(n-1,k)*(1/2)=d(n-1,k)$ ways of arrangements.Thus, $d(n,k+1)=2f(n-1,k)+d(n-1,k)$, which is the second equation.~Shawn", "We will split up our cases based on the positions of $A$, $B$, and $C$ relative to each other.Case $1$ : $A$ $B$ $C$ : $9$ casesCase $2$ : $A$ $C$ $B$ : $16$ casesCase $3$ : $B$ $A$ $C$ : $20$ casesSince we can reverse the first case to make $C$ $B$ $A$, reverse the second case to make $B$ $C$ $A$, and reverse the third case to make $C$ $A$ $B$, by symmetry we have $2(9+16+20) = \\boxed{090}$ ways in total.~xHypotenuse"]}, "2021_aime_i_problems/problem_12": {"id": {"year": 2021, "contest_name": "AIME I", "problem_number": 12}, "title": "2021 AIME I Problems/Problem 12", "problem": "Let $A_1A_2A_3\\ldots A_{12}$ be a dodecagon ( $12$ -gon).

Similarly, sequences with {30,40} and {40,50} will not give us any subtractions because those sequences must all include a 20. Let's stick with the lower ones for a minute: if we take them two at a time, then {3,5} will give us the subtraction of 1 sequence {3,5,7,9}. We have exhausted all pairs of numbers we can take, and if we take the triplet of single digit numbers, the only possible sequence must have a 6, which we already don't count. Therefore, we subtract $\\textbf{1}$ from the count of illegal sequences with any of the single-digit numbers and none of the numbers 30,40,50.\n(Note if we take only 1 at a time, there will have to be 3 of $a, b$, which is impossible.)If we have the sequence including {30,50}, we end up having negative values, so these do not give us any subtractions, and the triplet {30,40,50} gives us a 20. Hence by the same reasoning as earlier, we have 0 subtractions from the sequences with these numbers and none of the single digit numbers {3,4,5}.Finally, we count the sequences that are something like (one of 3,4,5,), $a, b$, (one of 30, 40, 50). If this is to be the case, then let $a$ be the starting value in the sequence. The sequence will be $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d$ ; We see that if we subtract the largest term by the smallest term we have $3d$, so the subtraction of one of (30,40,50) and one of (3,4,5) must be divisible by 3. Therefore the only sequences possible are $3,a,b,30; 4,a,b,40; 5,a,b,50$. Of these, only the last is invalid because it gives $b = 35$, larger than our bounds $6<a<b<30$.

We consider the complement, where new lines don't intersect other line segments. Simply observing, we see that the only line segments that don't intersect with the new lines are lines attached to some point that a new line does not pass through. If we look at a series of points on line $\\ell_B$ from left to right and a line connects $P$ to an arbitrary point, then the lines formed with that point and with remaining points on the left of that point never intersect with the line with $P$. Let there be $s$ points on lines $\\ell_A$ and $\\ell_B$ before $P$ was added. For each of the $s$ points on $\\ell_B$, we subtract the total number of lines formed, which is $s^2$, not counting $P$. Considering all possible points on $\\ell_B$, we get $(s^2-s)+(s^2-2s)\\cdots(s^2-s^2)$ total intersections. However, for each of the lines, there is one more bounded region than number of intersections, so we add $s$.

With similar reasoning, we see that the idea remains the same, except $s+1$ lines are formed with $P$ instead of just $s$ lines. Once again, each line from $P$ to a point on line $\\ell_A$ creates $s$ non-intersecting lines for that point and each point to its left. Subtracting from $s(s+1)$ lines and considering all possible lines created by $P$, we get $(s(s+1)-s)+(s(s+1)-2s)\\cdots(s(s+1)-s(s+1)$ intersections.

Simplying, we get $s(s+1)^2-s\\sum_{i=1}^{s+1}{i}+(s+1)$ newly bounded regions.For the base case $s=2$ for both lines, there are $4$ bounded regions. Next, we plug in $s=2,3,4$ for both formulas and plug $s=5$ for the first formula to find the number of regions when $m=6$ and $n=5$. Notice that adding a final point on $\\ell_A$ is a variation of our Case 1. The only difference is for each of the $s$ lines formed by $P$, there are $s+1$ points that can form a non-intersecting line. Therefore, we are subtracting a factor of $s+1$ lines instead of $s$ lines from a total of $s(s+1)$ lines. However, the number of lines formed by $P$ remains the same so we still add $s$ at the end when considering intersection points.

Therefore we desire $m$ to be placed before $n$ to create a second pass, and that after the first pass, the numbers $m$ through $13$ are lined up in order from least to greatest.To construct this, $n$ cannot go in the $n$ th position because all cards $1$ to $n-1$ will have to precede it and there will be no room for $m$.

Therefore the number of ways to reserve these slots for the $n-1$ cards is $\\binom{n}{n-1}$. Then there is only $1$ way to order these cards (since we want them in increasing order).

Your goal is to have a single path across all nodes on the grid leading back to $(0,\\ 0)$. For convenience, any grid position are presumed to be in $\\mod N$.Note that there are exactly two ways to reach node $(i,\\ j)$, namely $(i - 1,\\ j)$ and $(i,\\ j - 1)$.As a result, if a path includes a step from $(i,\\ j)$ to $(i + 1,\\ j)$, there cannot be a step from $(i,\\ j)$ to $(i,\\ j + 1)$. However, a valid solution must reach $(i,\\ j + 1)$, and the only valid step is from $(i - 1,\\ j + 1)$.So a solution that includes a step from $(i,\\ j)$ to $(i + 1,\\ j)$ dictates a step from $(i - 1,\\ j + 1)$ to $(i,\\ j + 1)$ and by extension steps from $(i - a,\\ j + a)$ to $(i - a + 1,\\ j + a)$. We observe the equivalent result for steps in the orthogonal direction.This means that in constructing a valid solution, taking one step in fact dictates N steps, thus it's sufficient to count valid solutions with $N = a + b$ moves of going right $a$ times and $b$ times up the grid.

Since there are $16$ subsets of $A$ that have size $3$ or higher, there is only one possibility for this case.Case 2: There are only sets of size $2$ or higher in $S$ :\nFirstly, there cannot be a no size $2$ set $S$, or it will be overcounting the first case.If there is only one such size $2$ set, there are $10$ ways to choose it. That size $2$ set, say $X$, cannot be in $S$ with $Y = A/X$ (a three element set). Thus, there are only $15$ possible size $3$ subsets that can be in $S$, giving us $10$ for this case.If there are two sets with size $2$ in $S$, we can choose the common elements of these two subsets in $5$ ways, giving us a total of $5\\cdot 6 = 30$.If there are three sets with size $2$, they can either share one common element, which can be done in $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ ways, or they can share pairwise common elements (sort of like a cycle), which can be done $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways.

Every remaining subsets $S$ will have $a$ as an element so $S\\cap{A}\\geq1$, since we just excluded all that do not. Since there are 15 subsets left, all are forced into the group of 16 subsets, so we just choose the number of $a$ to determine the set $A$. $A\\in\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ so there are 5 ways.For the rest of the cases, we assume there are no sets $A$ with cardinality 1. Notice that the only way to \"violate\" the condition is to have subsets $X$ and $Y$ with cardinalities 2 and 3 in some order. Otherwise, by the Pigeonhole Principle, if two sets both have cardinalities more than 3, they are bound to have one element of intersection. Say a set $S$ has $|S|=2$, then there is clearly only one set $s$ that will make $S\\cap{s}=0$. By our previous claim, all other subsets that have cardinality $c\\geq{3}$ will work.Now if we generalize a bit: If a subset has $N$ 2-element subsets which belong to set $M$, then there are exactly $N$ subsets with cardinality 3 that don't work. Therefore, the number of \"violating subsets\" are all subsets with cardinality $c\\leq{1}$, all 2-element subsets that are not in $M$, and all corresponding cardinality 3 subsets. Subtracting from the total 32 subsets, we get that $32-(1+5+(10-N)+N)=16$ subsets that do work. This includes all subsets in $M$, so the remaining non-violating subsets are forced. This is equivalent now to choosing $N$ 2 element subsets.Following casework on the number of 2-element subsets:If $N=1$ : There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways.If $N=2$ : There are $5$ ways to choose the intersection between the 2 sets (remember they have to have at least one element of intersection) and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the distinct elements in the subsets, so there are $5*6=30$ ways.If $N=3$ : It can be a cycle, where WLOG let the elements be $a,b,c$ so the sets are $\\{a,b\\}$, $\\{b,c\\}$, and $\\{c,a\\}$. This is just $\\binom{5}{3}=10$. Alternatively, it can also be the case where all sets share one element. There are 5 ways to choose this element and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the remaining elements to assign to each set. There are $30$ ways.If $N=4$ : By the Pigeonhole Principle, the only way all pairwise sets have at one common intersection is if all share one element in common. There are 5 ways to choose this element and the remaining numbers are forced. There are 5 ways.$N\\geq{5}$ does not provide any valid cases since to have all pairwise elements to intersect one element, they must be the same element by the Pigeonhole Principle, but there are not enough subsets.If $N=0$, then there is only one way since $\\binom{5}{3}+\\binom{5}{4}+\\binom{5}{5}=16$.Adding all cases yields $5+10+30+30+5+1=\\boxed{81}$ ways!-Magnetoninja"]}, "2023_aime_ii_problems/problem_6": {"id": {"year": 2023, "contest_name": "AIME II", "problem_number": 6}, "title": "2023 AIME II Problems/Problem 6", "problem": "Consider the L-shaped region formed by three unit squares joined at their sides, as shown below.

Let $b_1, b_2, \\cdots, b_n, b_{n+1}$ be the sequence of nonnegative integers such that $A_k$ has $b_k$ elements for all $1\\leq{}k\\leq{}n$, and $b_{n+1}=10$. Note that we can generate the number of valid sequences of $A$ by first generating all sequences of $b$ such that $b_i\\leq{}b_{i+1}$ for all $1\\leq{}i<n$, then choosing the elements from $A_{k+1}$ that we keep in $A_k$, given the sequence of $b$ as the restraint for the number of elements. For each sequence $b_1, b_2, \\cdots{}, b_{n+1}$, there are $\\prod_{i=2}^{n+1}\\binom{b_i}{b_{i-1}}$ corresponding sequences for $A$. Now, consider two cases - either all terms in $b$ are either 0, 5, or 10, or there is at least one term in $b$ that is neither 0, 5 nor 10. In the second case, consider the last term in $b$ that is not 10 or 5, say $b_m$. However, that implies $b_{m+1}=10$, and so the number of corresponding sequences of $A$ is $\\binom{10}{b_m}\\cdot{}$ something or $\\binom{5}{b_m}\\cdot$ something, which is always a multiple of $5$. Therefore, we only need to consider sequences of $b$ where each term is $0$ $5$ or $10$. If all terms in $b$ are 0 or 10, then for each $1\\leq{}n\\leq{}10$ there are $n+1$ sequences of $b$ (since there are $n+1$ places to turn from $0$ to $10$ ), for a total of $2+3+\\cdots+11=65\\equiv0$ (mod 5). If there exists at least one term $b_k=5$, then we use stars and bars to count the number of sequences of $b$, and each sequence of $b$ corresponds to $\\binom{10}{5}$ sequences of $A$. For each $n$, we must have at least one term of $5$. After that, there are $n-1$ stars and $2$ bars (separating $0$ to $5$ and $5$ to $10$ ), so that is $\\binom{n+1}{2}$ sequences of $b$. So the sum is $\\binom{2}{2}+\\binom{3}{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{11}{2}=\\binom{12}{3}\\equiv0$ (mod 5).

The element is in only $A_1$ and NOT in $A_2$.$3$.

Note that if we represent the scenario in this manner, we can think of picking a $1$ for one factor and then a $5$ for another factor to form their product - this is similar thinking to when we have the factorized form of a polynomial. Unfortunately this is not quite accurate to the problem because we can reach the same product in many ways: for example for $n=2$, $4$ can be reached by picking $1$ and $4$ or $2$ and $2$. However, this form gives us insights that will be useful later in the problem.Note that there are only $3$ primes in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ : $2,3,$ and $5$. Thus if we're forming the product of possible values of a dice roll, the product has to be written in the form $2^h \\cdot 3^i \\cdot 5^j$ (the choice of variables will become clear later), for integer nonnegative values $h,i,j$. So now the problem boils down to how many distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ can be formed by taking the product of $n$ dice values.We start our work on representing $j$ : the powers of $5$, because it is the simplest in this scenario because there is only one factor of $5$ in the set. Because of this, having $j$ fives in our prime factorization of the product is equivalent to picking $j$ factors from the polynomial $(1+\\dots + 6) \\cdots$ and choosing each factor to be a $5$. Now that we've selected $j$ factors, there are $n-j$ factors remaining to choose our powers of $3$ and $2$.Suppose our prime factorization of this product contains $i$ powers of $3$. These powers of $3$ can either come from a $3$ factor or a $6$ factor, but since both $3$ and $6$ contain only one power of $3$, this means that a product with $i$ powers of $3$ corresponds directly to picking $i$ factors from the polynomial, each of which is either $3$ or $6$ (but this distinction doesn't matter when we consider only the powers of $3$.Now we can reframe the problem again. Our method will be as follows: Suppose we choose an arbitrary pair $(i,j)$ that match the requirements, corresponding to the number of $3$ 's and the number of $5$ 's our product will have. Then how many different $h$ values for the powers of $2$ are possible?In the $i+j$ factors we have already chosen, we obviously can't have any factors of $2$ in the $j$ factors with $5$. However, we can have a factor of $2$ pairing with factors of $3$, if we choose a $6$. The maximal possible power of $2$ in these $i$ factors is thus $2^i$, which occurs when we pick every factor to be $6$.We now have $n-i-j$ factors remaining, and we want to allocate these to solely powers of $2$. For each of these factors, we can choose either a $1,2,$ or $4$. Therefore the maximal power of $2$ achieved in these factors is when we pick $4$ for all of them, which is equivalent to $2^{2\\cdot (n-i-j)}$.Now if we multiply this across the total $n$ factors (or $n$ dice) we have a total of $2^{2n-2i-2j} \\cdot 2^i = 2^{2n-i-2j}$, which is the maximal power of $2$ attainable in the product for a pair $(i,j)$. Now note that every power of $2$ below this power is attainable: we can simply just take away a power of $2$ from an existing factor by dividing by $2$. Therefore the powers of $2$, and thus the $h$ value ranges from $h=0$ to $h=2n-i-2j$, so there are a total of $2n+1-i-2j$ distinct values for $h$ for a given pair $(i,j)$.Now to find the total number of distinct triplets, we must sum this across all possible $i$ s and $j$ s. Lets take note of our restrictions on $i,j$ : the only restriction is that $i+j \\leq n$, since we're picking factors from $n$ dice.\\[\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} 2n+1 - \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j\\]We start by calculating the first term. $2n+1$ is constant, so we just need to find out how many pairs there are such that $i+j \\leq n$. Set $i$ to $0$ : $j$ can range from $0$ to $n$, then set $i$ to $1$ : $j$ can range from $0$ to $n-1$, etc. The total number of pairs is thus $n+1+n+n-1+\\dots+1 = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. Therefore the left summation evaluates to\n\n\\[\\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]Now we calculate $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j$. This simplifies to $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i + 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} j$. Note that because $i+j = n$ is symmetric with respect to $i,j$, the sum of $i$ in all of the pairs will be equal to the sum of $j$ in all of the pairs. Thus this is equal to calculating $3 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i$.In the pairs, $i=1$ appears for $j$ ranging between $0$ and $n-1$ so the sum here is $1 \\cdot (n)$. Similarly $i=2$ appears for $j$ ranging from $0$ to $n-2$, so the sum is $2 \\cdot (n-1)$. If we continue the pattern, the sum overall is $(n)+2 \\cdot (n-1) + 3 \\cdot (n-2) + \\dots + (n) \\cdot 1$.

So the key thought of this solution is to set a \"normalized\" combination for each product.$P=1^{k_1}\\cdot 2^{k_2} \\cdot 3^{k_3}\\cdot 4^{k_4}\\cdot 5^{k_5} \\cdot 6^{k_6}$, with $k_1+k_2+...+k_6=n$.For a fixed number of dice, it is easy to see that there are three basic \"transformation\": 1*6 = 2*3, 1*4 = 2*2, and 2*6 = 3*4, which does not change the number of dice. Other transformation like 1*6*6=3*3*4 can be viewed as a 1*6=2*3 combined with a 2*6=3*4.So we can transform any given combination into a \"normallised\" combination in this way: step 1, if there are 1 and 6, then transorm them into 2*3; step 2, if there are both 1 and 4, then transform them into a 2*2; step3: if there are both 2 and 6, then transform them into 3*4. Until no more basic transformation can be made.Now begin casework with $k_1$ :case 1( $k_1 <= k_6$ ): all \"1\"s cancel with \"6\"s, so the product contains only 2,3,4,5,6. And now:If \"2\"s are no more than remaining \"6\"s: all \"2\"s cancel with \"6\"s, so the \"nomarlized\" product consists of only $\"3456\"$, with the total number of dice unchanged. No transformation can be made now and it is the same with n stars and 3 bars, so there are $C^3_{n+3}$ ways.If \"2\"s are no less than remaining \"6\"s: all \"6\" cancels with \"2\", so the product consist of only $\"2345\"$. Again, there are $C^3_{n+3}$ ways.case 2( $k_1>=k_6$ ): all \"6\" cancels with \"1\", the remaining numbers are: 1,2,3,4,5; now if \"1\"s are no less than \"4\"s, then it can be transformed into product with only $\"1235\"$ ; there are, again, $C^3_{n+3}$ ways. if \"1\"s are no more than \"4\", then it is product with only 2,3,4,5, which is already counted before.So there are three major cases: $\"2345\"$, $\"3456\"$ and $\"1235\"$, each with $C^3_{n+3}$ ways. There are overlaps: $3^{k_3} 4^{k_4} 5^{k_5}$, which has $C^2_{n+2}$ ways, are counted in both $\"2345\"$ and $\"3456\"$, and $2^{k_2} 3^{k_3} 5^{k_5}$ are counted in both $\"2345\"$ and $\"1235\"$.So, the final number is:\n\n\\[3C^3_{n+3}-2C^2_{n+2}=\\frac{(n+1)^2 (n+2)}{2},\\]\n\nand now any possible product is counted exactly once. And then it is easily to find out $n = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) 11}}$.~FireSirius", "We define:$a_n$ is the number of possible products of the results of $n$ dice being rolled.Now consider a modified five-sided die that excludes $5$, having faces $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $6$. Let the number of possible products of the results of $n$ of these modified dice be equal to $b_n$.If in the $n$ rolls of the dice, we roll $5$ zero times, then the number of distinct products is equal to $b_n$. If we roll $5$ once, then the number of distinct products is equal to $b_{n-1}$. In general, if we roll $5$ $i$ times, then the number of distinct products is equal to $b_{n-i}$. Between the different cases of how many times we roll $5$, the products are guaranteed to be distinct. This is because in their prime factorizations, the powers of $5$ are different, and by the Fundmamental Theorem of Arithmetic, the products must be different as well.In other words, we have found:\n\n\\[a_n=\\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_i\\]Now let us focus on $b_n$, and from now on, until otherwise specified, the die will refer to the modified, 5-sided die.\nIn these $n$ rolls of the dice, if we roll $3$ zero times and $6$ zero times, then the product must be a power of $2$. It can range from $2^0$ to $4^n$, which is equal to $2^{2n}$. Therefore, there are $2n+1$ possible products. If we either roll $3$ once or $6$ once (not both), then the product must be $3$ times a power of $2$. This power of $2$ can range from $2^0$ to $2^{2(n-1)+1}=2^{2n-1}$, when we roll one $6$ and all other rolls are $4$. Therefore, there are $2n$ products. In general, if we roll $3$ and $6$ a combined $i$ times, then the product must be in the form $2^k * 3^i$, and $k$ ranges from $0$ to $2(n-i)+i=2n-i$, resulting in $2n-i+1$ products.In other words, we have found:\n\n\\[b_n=\\sum_{i=0}^{n} 2n-i+1\\]We can now calculate $b_n$.

Each such $n$ -digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$ -digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$ -digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$ -digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$ - and $(n - 2)$ -digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$ -digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$ - and $(n - 2)$ -digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.Thus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = 880$."]}, "mock_aime_4_2006-2007_problems/problem_8": {"id": {"year": -1, "contest_name": "Mock AIME 4 2006-2007", "problem_number": 8}, "title": "Mock AIME 4 2006-2007 Problems/Problem 8", "problem": "The number of increasing sequences of positive integers $a_1 \\le a_2 \\le a_3 \\le \\cdots \\le a_{10} \\le 2007$ such that $a_i-i$ is even for $1\\le i \\le 10$ can be expressed as ${m \\choose n}$ for some positive integers $m > n$.

This has probability $\\frac{1}{6^4}$ of occurring.Case 2: Two 5's are rolled.Case 3: No 5's are rolled.To find the number of outcomes for the latter two cases, we will use recursion. Consider a 5-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. For $n \\ge 1$, let $a_n$ equal the number of outcomes after rolling the die $n$ times, with the property that the product is a square.

If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3.

However, the original ascending order has been counted $n$ times, and each order that arises by switching two neighboring cards has been counted twice. Hence the number of arrangements where one card can be removed resulting in the remaining cards' being in ascending order is $n^2-(n-1)-(n-1)=(n-1)^2+1.$ When $n = 6$, this is $(6-1)^2+1 = 26$, and the final answer is $2\\cdot26 = \\boxed{52}$.", "For ascending, if the $1$ goes in anything but the first two slots, the rest of the numbers have to go in ascending from $2$, which are $4$ cases if there are $6$ cards.

We can also realize that this is completely symmetrical if the sequence is in descending order. For example, we could have $54321$, and we could plug in a 6 in 6 of the spaces.
