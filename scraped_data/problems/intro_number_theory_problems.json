      "$11|(q+r)$ implies that $11|(99q+q+r)$ and therefore $11|(100q+r)$, so $11|n$. Then, $n$ can range from $10010$ to $99990$ for a total of $\\boxed{8181\\Rightarrow \\mathrm{(B)}}$ numbers.When a $5$ -digit number is divided by $100$, the first $3$ digits become the quotient, $q$, and the last $2$ digits become the remainder, $r$.Therefore, $q$ can be any integer from $100$ to $999$ inclusive, and $r$ can be any integer from $0$ to $99$ inclusive.For each of the $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ possible values of $q$, there are at least $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{11} \\right\\rfloor = 9$ possible values of $r$ such that $q+r \\equiv 0\\pmod{11}$.Since there is $1$ \"extra\" possible value of $r$ that is congruent to $0\\pmod{11}$, each of the $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{900}{11} \\right\\rfloor = 81$ values of $q$ that are congruent to $0\\pmod{11}$ have $1$ more possible value of $r$ such that $q+r \\equiv 0\\pmod{11}$. Another way to think about it is the number of possible values of q when r, the remainder, is $0$. In this case, q itself has to be a multiple of $11$. $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{999}{11} = 90 \\right\\rfloor$. Then we'll need to subtract $9$ from $90$ since we only want multiples of $11$ greater than $100$ $(90-9=81)$Therefore, the number of possible values of $n$ such that $q+r \\equiv 0\\pmod{11}$ is $900\\cdot9+81\\cdot1=8181 \\rightarrow B$.Let $n$ equal $\\overline{abcde}$, where $a$ through $e$ are digits. Therefore,$q=\\overline{abc}=100a+10b+c$$r=\\overline{de}=10d+e$We now take $q+r\\bmod{11}$ :$q+r=100a+10b+c+10d+e\\equiv a-b+c-d+e\\equiv 0\\bmod{11}$The divisor trick for 11 is as follows:\"Let $n=\\overline{a_1a_2a_3\\cdots a_x}$ be an $x$ digit integer. If $a_1-a_2+a_3-\\cdots +(-1)^{x-1} a_x$ is divisible by $11$, then $n$ is also divisible by $11$.\"Therefore, the five-digit number $n$ is divisible by 11. The 5-digit multiples of 11 range from $910\\cdot 11$ to $9090\\cdot 11$. There are $8181\\Rightarrow \\mathrm{(B)}$ divisors of 11 between those inclusive.Since $q$ is a quotient and $r$ is a remainder when $n$ is divided by $100$. So we have $n=100q+r$. Since we are counting choices where $q+r$ is divisible by $11$, we have $n=99q+q+r=99q+11k$ for some $k$. This means that $n$ is the sum of two multiples of $11$ and would thus itself be a multiple of $11$. Then we can count all the five-digit multiples of $11$ as in Solution 2. (This solution is essentially the same as Solution 3, but it does not necessarily involve mods and so could potentially be faster.)Defining $q$ and $r$ in terms of floor functions and $n$ would yield: $q=\\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{100} \\right \\rfloor$ and $r=n-100 \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{100} \\right \\rfloor$. Since $q+r \\equiv 0\\pmod{11}$, $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{100} \\right \\rfloor + n-100 \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{100} \\right \\rfloor \\equiv 0\\pmod{11}$. Simplifying gets us $n-99 \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{100} \\right \\rfloor\\equiv 0\\pmod{11} \\rightarrow n \\equiv 0\\pmod{11}$ ( $99 \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{100} \\right \\rfloor\\equiv 0\\pmod{11}$ is always true since floor function always yields an integer, and 99 is divisible by 11 w/o any remainder). After we come to this conclusion, it becomes easy to solve the rest of the problem ( $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{99999} \\right \\rfloor - \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{10000} \\right \\rfloor$ ).\n~hw21"

This estimate clearly shows that there are not even any integers, let alone factors of $60$, between $7$ and $\\sqrt{60}$. Accordingly, exactly half of the positive factors of $60$ are in fact less than $7$, so the answer is precisely $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(E)}\\ \\frac{1}{2}}$.Testing all positive integers less than $7$, we find that $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ all divide $60$.

    "solutions": [
      "Let $x = 10a+b, y = 10b+a$. The given conditions imply $x>y$, which implies $a>b$, and they also imply that both $a$ and $b$ are nonzero.Then, $x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = (9a - 9b)(11a + 11b) = 99(a-b)(a+b) = m^2$.Since this must be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. $99$ factorizes into $3^2 \\cdot 11$, so $11|(a-b)(a+b)$. However, the maximum value of $a-b$ is $9-1=8$, so $11|a+b$. The maximum value of $a+b$ is $9+8=17$, so $a+b=11$.Then, we have $33^2(a-b) = m^2$, so $a-b$ is a perfect square, but the only perfect squares that are within our bound on $a-b$ are $1$ and $4$. We know $a+b=11$, and, for $a-b=1$, adding equations to eliminate $b$ gives us $2a=12 \\Longrightarrow a=6, b=5$. Testing $a-b=4$ gives us $2a=15 \\Longrightarrow a=\\frac{15}{2}, b=\\frac{7}{2}$, which is impossible, as $a$ and $b$ must be digits. Therefore, $(a,b) = (6,5)$, and $x+y+m=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }154}$.",
      "The first steps are the same as Solution 1. Let $x = 10a+b, y = 10b+a$, where we know that a and b are digits (whole numbers less than $10$ ).Like Solution 1, we end up getting $(9a - 9b)(11a + 11b) = 99(a-b)(a+b) = m^2$. This is where the solution diverges.We know that the left side of the equation is a perfect square because $m$ is an integer. If we factor $99$ into its prime factors, we get $3^2\\cdot 11$. In order to get a perfect square on the left side, $(a-b)(a+b)$ must make both prime exponents even. Because the a and b are digits, a simple guess would be that $(a+b)$ (the bigger number) equals $11$ while $(a-b)$ is a factor of nine (1 or 9). The correct guesses are $a = 6, b = 5$ causing $x = 65, y = 56,$ and $m = 33$. The sum of the numbers is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }154}$",
      "Once again, the solution is quite similar as the above solutions. Since $x$ and $y$ are two digit integers, we can write $x = 10a+b, y = 10b+a$ and because $x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$, substituting and factoring, we get $99(a+b)(a-b) = m^2$.Therefore, $(a+b)(a-b) = \\frac{m^2}{99}$ and $\\frac{m^2}{99}$ must be an integer. A quick strategy is to find the smallest such integer $m$ such that $\\frac{m^2}{99}$ is an integer. We notice that 99 has a prime factorization of $3^2 \\cdot 11.$Let $m^2 = n.$ Since we need a perfect square and 3 is already squared, we just need to square 11. So $3^2 \\cdot 11^2$ gives us 1089 as $n$ and $m = \\sqrt{1089} = 33.$ We now get the equation $(x-y)(x+y) = 33^2$, which we can also write as $(x-y)(x+y) = 11^2 \\cdot 3^2$.A very simple guess assumes that $x-y=3^2$ and $x+y=11^2$ since $x$ and $y$ are positive. Finally, we come to the conclusion that $x=65$ and $y=56$, so $x+y+m$ $=$ $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }154}$.Note that all of the solutions used $a+b$ or $a-b$ as part of their solution.",
      "Continue the same as Solution $3$ until we get $33$. Knowing that $33^2 = 1089$, we have narrowed down our Pythagorean triples. We know that the $2$ other squares should be larger than $33^2$, so we can start testing.If we start testing the $40$ s, it is fruitless since the closest to $33^2$ would be $33 - 45 - 54$ which is not a Pythagorean triple. We can start by testing out the $50$ s, and it turns our that $33 - 56 - 65$ is a Pythagorean triple. Therefore, our answer is $33+56+65$ = $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }154}$.~Arcticturn"

      "Let $S$ be the set of the ages of Mr. Jones' children (in other words $i \\in S$ if Mr. Jones has a child who is $i$ years old). Then $|S| = 8$ and $9 \\in S$. Let $m$ be the positive integer seen on the license plate. Since at least one of $4$ or $8$ is contained in $S$, we have $4 | m$.We would like to prove that $5 \\not\\in S$, so for the sake of contradiction, let us suppose that $5 \\in S$. Then $5\\cdot 4 = 20 | m$ so the units digit of $m$ is $0$. Since the number has two distinct digits, each appearing twice, another digit of $m$ must be $0$. Since Mr. Jones can't be $00$ years old, the last two digits can't be $00$. Therefore $m$ must be of the form $d0d0$, where $d$ is a digit. Since $m$ is divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits of $m$ must be divisible by $9$ (see Divisibility rules for 9 ). Hence $9 | 2d$ which implies $d = 9$. But $m = 9090$ is not divisible by $4$, contradiction. So $5 \\not\\in S$ and $5$ is not the age of one of Mr. Jones' kids. $\\boxed{ B }$(We might like to check that there does, indeed, exist such a positive integer $m$. If $5$ is not an age of one of Mr. Jones' kids, then the license plate's number must be a multiple of $lcm(1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9) = 504$. Since $11\\cdot504 = 5544$ and $5544$ is the only $4$ digit multiple of $504$ that fits all the conditions of the license plate's number, the license plate's number is $5544$.)Alternatively, we can see that if one of Mr. Jones' children is of the age 5, then the license plate will have to end in the digit $0$. The license plate cannot end in the digit $5$ as $2$ is a factor of the number, so it must be even. This means that the license plate would have to have two $0$ digits, and would either be of the form $XX00$ or $X0X0$ (X being the other digit in the license plate). The condition $XX00$ is impossible as Mr. Jones can't be $00$ years old. If we separate the second condition, $X0X0$ into its prime factors, we get $X\\cdot 10\\cdot 101$. $101$ is prime, and therefore can't account for allowing $X0X0$ being evenly divisible by the childrens' ages. The $10$ accounts for the 5 and one factor of 2. This leaves $X$, but no single digit number contains all the prime factors besides 5 and 2 of the childrens' ages, thus $5$ $\\boxed{ B }$ can't be one of the childrens' ages.Another way to do the problem is by the process of elimination. The only possible correct choices are the highest powers of each prime, $2^3=8$, $3^2=9$, $5^1=5$, and $7^1=7$, since indivisibility by any powers lower than these means indivisibility by a higher power of the prime (for example, indivisibility by $2^2=4$ means indivisibility by $2^3=8)$. Since the number is divisible by $9$, it is not the answer, and the digits have to add up to $9$. Let $(a,b)$ be the digits: since $2\\cdot(a+b) | 9$, $(a+b)|9$. The only possible choices for $(a,b)$ are $(0,9)$, $(1,8)$, $(2,7)$, $(3,6)$, and $(4,5)$. The only number that works is $5544$, but it is not divisible by $5$. $\\boxed{ B }$~edited by mobius247Since 5 has the \"strictest\" divisibility rules of the single digit numbers, we check that case first. To be divisible by 9, the other repeating digit must be 4. Seeing that 5544 is the only arrangement of 2 4's and 2 5's that is divisible by the other single digit numbers and itself is not divisible by 5, the answer is $\\boxed {(B) 5}$.\n-liu4505\n~edited by mobius247"

One can easily deduce that none of the numbers are even near a cube so the second case is not possible. We now look at the case of $a \\cdot b$. The four factors of this number would be $1$, $a$, $b$, and $ab$. The sum of these would be $ab+a+b+1$, which can be factored into the form $(a+1)(b+1)$. Easily we can see that now we can take cases again.Case 1: Either $a$ or $b$ is 2.If this is true then we have to have that one of $(a+1)$ or $(b+1)$ is odd and that one is 3. The other is still even. So we have that in this case the only numbers that work are even multiples of 3 which are 2010 and 2016. So we just have to check if either $\\frac{2016}{3} - 1$ or $\\frac{2010}{3} - 1$ is a prime. We see that in this case none of them work.Case 2: Both $a$ and $b$ are odd primes.This implies that both $(a+1)$ and $(b+1)$ are even which implies that in this case the number must be divisible by $4$. This leaves only $2012$ and $2016$.\n$2012={4}\\cdot{503}$ so either $(a+1)$ or $(b+1)$ both have a factor of $2$ or one has a factor of $4$ since $503$ is prime. If it was the first case, then $a$ or $b$ will equal $1$. That means that either $(a+1)$ or $(b+1)$ has a factor of $4$. That means that $a$ or $b$ is $502$ which isn't a prime, so 2012 does not work. $2016 = 4 \\cdot 504$ so we have $(503 + 1)(3 + 1)$. 503 and 3 are both odd primes, so 2016 is a solution.

Okay now we have to split into cases based on which digit gets carried. This meaning, when you add a 3 digit number to 864, we have to know when to carry the digits. Note that if you don't understand any of the steps I take, just try adding any 3-digit number to 864 regularly (using the old-fashioned \"put one number over the other\" method, not mental calculation), and observe what you do at each step.(1) $\\textcolor{red}{*}$ None of the digits get carried over to the next space:\nSo this means $a_2<2, a_1<4$ and $a_0<6$.

This case works but we still have to make sure it's possible for $a_2+a_1+a_0=20$ (We assumed this is true, so we have to find a number that works.) Since only the second and first digit carry over, $a_2>0, a_1>3$ and $a_0<6$. The smallest value we can get with this is 695. Let's see if we can find a smaller one:(5)The first and third digit carry over (but not the second)$s(864+n)=1+(8+a_2-10)+(7+a_1)+(4+a_0-10)=20$The largest value for the middle digit is 2, so the other digits have to be both 9's.

I did this when I mocked this test, it gave me the answer in 5 min. Basically you just bash out all of the three digit numbers whose digit sum is 20 and you'll find (quickly) that the answer is $\\boxed{695}$$\\textcolor{red}{*}$ Note to author: Since we have $a_2+a_1+a_0=20$, this implies that $a_2$ must be at least $2$ (since $a_1+a_0 \\le 18$ ), and therefore the first digit must ALWAYS carry. This is presumably the reason where the case where the second and third digits were carried but not the first was omitted, but for this reason cases (1) and (3) are also unnecessary.",
      "First, it is easy to verify that $695$ works and that no other numbers beginning with the digit 6 work (i.e. $686, 677, 668, 659$ do not work).Suppose by contradiction that there is a smaller valid $n$, where the leading digit of the three-digit number $n$ is 5 or less. (Two-digit $n$ obviously do not work because 9 + 9 < 20.) Clearly $n > 200$ because the smallest three-digit number whose digits sum to 20 is $299$. Also, because the second digit is at most 9, the units digit is at least 6, which means that the addition $N = n + 864$ regroups in the ones place. Then the units digit of $N$ is clearly less than 4. But as $1000 < 200 + 864 < N < 600 + 864 = 1464$, the sum of the thousands digit and the hundredth digit is at most 5. Because the second digit is at most 9, the sum of the digits of $N$ is at most $5 + 9 + 4 < 20$, contradiction. Hence $\\boxed{695}$ is the answer.",
      "During the real test, I immediately noticed that $n$ must be less than 1000 (AIME problem) and that $n$ must be a three-digit number. Therefore, I began casework on the leading digit of $n$. The casework was not intensive (how many ways are there to have digits sum to 20?) and I eventually got 695 as my answer. The rigorous proof that 695 was the smallest came afterwards.",
      "First of all, notice that the smallest $n$ with $s(n) = 20$ is $299$. Also, if $s(n + 864) = 20$, $s(n - 136) = 19$ (because subtracting $1000$ from the number removes the $1$ in the thousands place). After checking $s(n - 136)$ for various $n$ with $s(n) = 20$, we see that we need to have a carry when subtracting $136$. To have this, we must either have a $2$ in the tens place or a $5$ in the units place. The minimum $n$ for the former is $929$, and for the latter it is $695$. We check and see that $s(695-136) = s(559) = 19$, so our answer is $\\boxed{695}$.",
      "Observation (Lemma)\u00a0: If r is the number of regroups in the addition of n+k, $S(n+k) = S(n)+S(k)-9r$.Proof\u00a0: When you add two numbers, and you do a carry, you are taking away 10 from 1 column, and adding 1 to another column, giving a net loss of 9 to the total.Thus, we can see that we need to regroup exactly twice when we add 864. And, the lowest possible n is 299, so let's start from there.299 gets three regroups, so we are going to need to take away from digits, and dump the excess in the hundred's place, since the hundreds are going to regroup anyways.So, if we take away from the tens digit, we need to take away until we get 2 in the tens digit(since the ones will regroup). So, we get the number 929, which works (929+864 = 1793), but is not the smallest.If we take away from the ones digit, we only have to take away 4, turning the unit's place to 5. 5+4 is 9, so it won't regroup. Dump the ones into the hundred's place, and we get the number $\\boxed{695}$-AlexLikeMath",
      "Although this solution doesn't directly solve the problem, it greatly hastens the bashing process.Call the three digits a, b, and c.When you add each of 8, 6, and 4 to a, b, and c the resultant will either get smaller or larger, depending on the original number.e.g. If c is 7, then adding 4 will reduce the 7 to a 1, whilst leaving a one for b.If c is 3, then adding 4 will simply add four to the total, and make the 3 a 7.Each of 8, 6, and 4 all can reduce the original number by a certain amount and can increase the original number by a certain amount.8 can reduce by 2 for all numbers greater than 1, 6 can reduce numbers by 4, and 4 can reduce numbers by 6.Possibilities:-2, +8, (although this becomes obviously impossible later on) -4, +6, -6, +4Also, realize that if the number is reduced, then a one will be carried to the following decimal place on the left, consequently reducing that amount they reduce. It's like a puzzle! Within no time you should find that if you add 4 to c, subtract 4 from b, subtract 1 from a, and leave a 1 in the thousands place, the total is equated to zero. This is optimal because most of the addition is kept to the left, where the effect to real value is less. (e.g. 299 is smaller than 992)Now you have +1, -1, -4, +4 in the decimals, and a VERY fast trial and error gives $\\boxed{695}.$-Jackshi2006Postscript by Jackshi2006When I revisited the problem I realized that you can actually list out every possible number for n. 695 stands out very clearly as the smallest, because the only other possibility is 595, which doesn\u2019t add to 20 to begin with.",
      "First, note that to compute $s(m+n)$ (for any positive integers $m$ and $n$ ), one can simply find the sum of $s(m)$ and $s(n)$ minus 9 times the number of times one regroups when adding $m$ to $n$. One can see why this is by noticing that if one were to \"forget\" to regroup, and leave, say, a 10 in the ones' place, the sum of the digits would be 9 higher than if one did regroup. Anyway, one can see that the smallest 3-digit number (on AIME, all the answers are integers from 0 to 999) whose digits sum to 20 is 299. If we add this number to 864, we have to regroup 3 times, so $s(299+864)$ will be $9=9\\cdot3-(8+6+4)$ smaller than $s(299)$. We want this difference to be 0, so we need to find a way to only regroup two times.We now notice that regrouping the hundreds is inevitable, so we must either prevent regrouping the ones or the tens. Preventing regrouping the tens would require moving many of the tens to the hundreds' place (the ones' place is already full), which is bad when we are trying to minimize the number, but preventing regrouping the ones requires moving fewer ones to the hundreds' place.We find that to preventing regrouping the ones, the ones' place of our number must be at most 5 (a larger number would sum to ten when added to 4). Because we want to minimize the number of ones we move to the hundreds' place, we leave exactly 5 by moving four ones to the hundreds' place: $299\\to\\boxed{695}$.~ SymbolicPermutation",

We can now substitute $g$ with $k+n-1$. Now we substitute our new value of $g$ into $\\frac {n \\cdot (k+g)}{2}$ to get that the sum is $\\frac {n \\cdot (k+k+n-1)}{2} = 345$.This simplifies to $\\frac {n \\cdot (2k+n-1)}{2} = 345$. This gives a nice equation. We multiply out the 2 to get that $n \\cdot (2k+n-1)=690$. This leaves us with 2 integers that multiply to $690$ which leads us to think of factors of $690$. We know the factors of $690$ are: $1,2,3,5,6,10,15,23,30,46,69,115,138,230,345,690$. So through inspection (checking), we see that only $2,3,5,6,10,15$ and $23$ work.

Therefore, we know that, as there are $9$ solutions for $k$, there must be $9$ solutions for $c-1$. We know that this must be a perfect square. Testing perfect squares, we see that $c-1=36$, so $c=37$. Therefore, $j=38$. Now, since $j-1=37$, by similar logic, $37=(1+k)(a-1)$, so $k=36$ and Joey will be $38+36=74$ and the sum of the digits is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}$.",

Therefore, the difference between Chloe and Zoe's age is $36$, so Chloe is $37$, and Joey is $38$. The common factor that will divide both of their ages is $37$, so Joey will be $74$.

We are told that $C+n$ is a multiple of $Z+n$ exactly nine times. Because $Z+n$ is $1$ at $n=0$ and will increase until greater than $C-Z$, it will hit every natural number less than $C-Z$, including every factor of $C-Z$. For $C+n$ to be an integral multiple of $Z+n$, the difference $C-Z$ must also be a multiple of $Z$, which happens if $Z$ is a factor of $C-Z$. Therefore, $C-Z$ has nine factors. The smallest number that has nine positive factors is $2^23^2=36$. (We want it to be small so that Joey will not have reached three digits of age before his age is a multiple of Zoe's.) We also know $Z=1$ and $J=C+1$.

Soon, we see that $n+120\\pmod {63}$ decreases by $6$ every time we add $120$, so we can quickly see that $n=1917$ because at that point $n+120\\equiv21\\pmod {63}$.

      "First, we find $n$. We know that it is greater than $1000$, so we first input $n = 1000$. From the first equation, $\\gcd(63, n + 120) = 21$, we know that if $n$ is correct, after we add $120$ to it, it should be divisible by $21$, but not $63$ :\n\n\\[\\frac{n + 120}{21} = \\frac{1120}{21} = 53\\text{ R }7.\\]\n\nThis does not work. To get to the nearest number divisible by $21$, we have to add $14$ to cancel out the remainder. (Note that we don't subtract $7$ to get to $53$ ; $n$ is already at its lowest possible value!)\nAdding $14$ to $1000$ gives us $n = 1014$. (Note: $n$ is currently divisible by 63, but that's fine since we'll be changing it in the next step.)Now using the second equation, $\\gcd(n + 63, 120) = 60$, we know that if $n$ is correct, then $n+63$ is divisible by $60$ but not $120$ :\n\n\\[\\frac{n + 63}{60} = \\frac{1077}{60} = 17\\text{ R }57.\\]\n\nAgain, this does not work. This requires some guessing and checking. We can add $21$ over and over again until $n$ is valid. This changes $n$ while also maintaining that $\\frac{n + 120}{21}$ has no remainders.\nAfter adding $21$ once, we get $18 r 18$. By pure luck, adding $21$ two more times gives us $19$ with no remainders.\nWe now have $1077 + 21 + 21 + 21 = 1140$. However, this number is divisible by $120$. To get the next possible number, we add the LCM of $21$ and $60$ (once again, to maintain divisibility), which is $420$. Unfortunately, $1140 + 420 = 1560$ is still divisible by $120$. Adding $420$ again gives us $1980$, which is valid. However, remember that this is equal to $n + 63$, so subtracting $63$ from $1980$ gives us $1917$, which is $n$.The sum of its digits are $1 + 9 + 1 + 7 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 18}$.~primegn",

      "As in Solution 1, we prime factorize $2020$ as $2^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 101$, and we recall the standard formula that the number of positive factors of an integer is found by adding $1$ to each exponent in its prime factorization, and then multiplying these. Thus $2020$ has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12$ factors. The only number which has one factor is $1$. For a number to have exactly two factors, it must be prime, and the only prime factors of $2020$ are $2$, $5$, and $101$. For a number to have three factors, it must be a square of a prime (this follows from the standard formula mentioned above), and from the prime factorization, the only square of a prime that is a factor of $2020$ is $4$. Thus, there are $5$ factors of $2020$ which themselves have $1$, $2$, or $3$ factors (namely $1$, $2$, $4$, $5$, and $101$ ), so the number of factors of $2020$ that have more than $3$ factors is $12-5=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }7}$.",

However, this argument has exceptions where $a$ and $b$ share a nontrivial common factor, which in this case can only be two. There are two cases - One in which $5$ and $101$ divide the same factor, WLOG assumed to be $a$, so that $d(a) = 2^3 > 3$ and $d(b) = 2$, as otherwise.

Both of these are valid solutions, so the 4th-to-last number can be either $1$ or $8$. If it is $1$, then by the argument we have just made, the 5th-to-last number has to be $2$, the 6th-to-last number has to be $4$, and the 7th-to-last number, which is the first number, must be either $1$ or $8$. In this way, we have ultimately found two solutions: $N=1$ and $N=8$.On the other hand, if the 4th-to-last number is $8$, substituting $8$ into the inverse formulae shows that the 5th-to-last number is either $16$ or $\\frac{7}{3}$, but the latter is not an integer. Substituting $16$ shows that if $I$ is even, $I=32$, but if I is odd, $I=5$, and both of these are valid. If the 6th-to-last number is $32$, then the first number must be $64$, since $\\frac{31}{3}$ is not an integer; if the 6th-to-last number is $5,$ then the first number has to be $10$, as $\\frac{4}{3}$ is not an integer.

We use the fact that every positive integer has a unique binary representation:If $a_1 \\neq b_2$ then $\\{a_1,b_2\\} = \\{a_2,b_1\\}$ ; from here we can deduce either $a_1=a_2$ and $b_1=b_2$ (contradicting the assumption that $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$, or $a_1=b_1$ and $a_2=b_2$ (contradicting the assumption $a_1>b_1$ and $a_2>b_2$ ).If $a_1 = b_2$ then $2^{a_1}+2^{b_2} = 2 \\times 2^{a_1}$, and it follows that $a_1=a_2=b_1=b_2$, also contradicting the assumption $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$. Hence we obtain contradiction.*Then there are $\\binom{11}{2}-5$ choices for $(a,b)$ for which $2^a - 2^b$ is a positive integer less than 1000; by the above claim, each choice of $(a,b)$ results in a different positive integer $n$. Then there are $55-5 = \\boxed{050}$ integers which can be expressed as a difference of two powers of 2.Note by Ross Gao",
      "Case 1: When our answer is in the form $2^n-2^i$, where $i$ is an integer such that $0\\le i\\le 4$.We start with the subcase where it is $2^n-2^0$, for some integer $n$ where $n>0$ (this is because the case where $n=0$ yields $2^0-2^0=0$, which doesn't work because it must be a positive integer.)\nNote that $2^{10}=1024$, and $2^9=512$. Our answer needs to be less than $1000$, so the maximum possible result (in this case) is $2^9-2^0$. Our lowest result is $2^1-2^0$. All the positive powers of two less than $1024$ work, so we have $9$ possibilities for this subcase. For subcases $i=1, i=2, i=3,$ and $i=4$, we have $8, 7, 6,$ and $5$ possibilities, respectively.Case 2: When our answer is in the form of $2^n-2^j$, where $j$ is an integer such that $5\\le j\\le 9$.We can start with the subcase where $j=5$. We notice that $2^5=32$, and $2^{10}-2^5=992$ which is less than $1000$, so the greatest result in this subcase is actually $2^{10}-2^5$, and the lowest is $2^6-2^5$. Thus, we have $5$ possibilities. For the other four subcases, we have $4, 3, 2,$ and $1$ possibilities, respectively.Answer:\nWe note that these are our only cases, as numbers in the form of $2^n-2^{10}$ and beyond are greater than $1000$.Thus, our result is $9+8+7+6+5+5+4+3+2+1=(9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1)+5=\\boxed{50}$. ~jehu26",

However, we also need to consider the case in which $n=10$. With simple counting, we find that $5$ numbers: $(32, 64, 128, 256, 512)$ could be subtracted from $1024$, which makes another 5 cases. There is no need to check for higher exponents since the lowest difference would be $2^{11} - 2^{10} = 1024$, which exceeds $1000$.Thus, the final answer is $\\binom{10}{2} + 5 = \\boxed{050}.$~TOMYANG"

      "Let $x$ be the number of people at the party before the bus arrives. We know that $x\\equiv 0\\pmod {12}$, as $\\frac{5}{12}$ of people at the party before the bus arrives are adults. Similarly, we know that $x + 50 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$, as $\\frac{11}{25}$ of the people at the party are adults after the bus arrives. $x + 50 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$ can be reduced to $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$, and since we are looking for the minimum amount of people, $x$ is $300$. That means there are $350$ people at the party after the bus arrives, and thus there are $350 \\cdot \\frac{11}{25} = \\boxed{154}$ adults at the party.~eamo",
      "Since at the beginning, adults make up $\\frac{5}{12}$ of the concert, the amount of people must be a multiple of 12.Call the amount of people in the beginning $x$.Then $x$ must be divisible by 12, in other words: $x$ must be a multiple of 12.\nSince after 50 more people arrived, adults make up $\\frac{11}{25}$ of the concert, $x+50$ is a multiple of 25. This means $x+50$ must be a multiple of 5.Notice that if a number is divisible by 5, it must end with a 0 or 5. Since 5 is impossible (obviously, since multiples of 12 end in 2, 4, 6, 8, 0,...), $x$ must end in 0.Notice that the multiples of 12 that end in 0 are: 60, 120, 180, etc.. By trying out, you can clearly see that $x=300$ is the minimum number of people at the concert.So therefore, after 50 more people arrive, there are $300+50=350$ people at the concert, and the number of adults is $350*\\frac{11}{25}=154$. Therefore the answer is $\\boxed{154}$.I know this solution is kind of lame, but this is still pretty straightforward. This solution is very similar to the first one, though.~hastapasta",
      "Let $a$ be the number of adults before the bus arrived and $x$ be the total number of people at the concert. So, $\\frac{a}{x}=\\frac{5}{12}$. Solving for $x$ in terms of $a$, $x = \\frac{12}{5}a$. After the bus arrives, let's say there are an additional $y$ adults out of the 50 more people who enter the concert. From that, we get $\\frac{a+y}{x+50}=\\frac{11}{25}$. Replacing $x$ with the value of $a$, the second equation becomes $\\frac{a+y}{\\frac{12}{5}a+50}=\\frac{11}{25}$.By cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get that $25(y-22)=\\frac{7a}{5}$.Observe that we must make sure $y-22$ is positive and divisible by $7$ to have an integer value of $a$. The smallest possible value of $y$ that satisfies this conditions is $29$. Plugging this into the equation, $a = 125$. The question asks for the minimum number of adults that are there after the bus arrives, which is $a+y$. Thus, the answer is simply $125+29=\\boxed{154}$.~mathical8"

If you have closely studied magic squares, you might know that in a three by three magic square that is to be filled in with the integers $1$ through $9$, the center of the square would be $5$ (the average of the numbers), and the numbers in the corners should be even(*).

Label the nine small squares within the magic square from $a$ to $i$ from left to right, top to bottom. Firstly, we know that $a+i$ and $c+g$ sum to $10$ since the center square is $5$. Thus, $a$ and $i$ must have the same parity, and so must $c$ and $g$. Suppose that $a$ and $c$ have different parity. Since $a+b+c=15$, $b$ must be even. By a similar argument, $h$ must also be even, and so must $d$ and $f$. Our initial assumption is that one of $a$ and $c$ is odd and the other is even; however, we end up with six even numbers needed to fill in the square, but there are only four even integers from $1$ to $9$. Now suppose that all of $a, c, g,$ and $i$ are odd. This would make each of $b, d, f,$ and $h$ odd, but clearly we do not have enough odd numbers to make all nine numbers odd.

Then, we can notice that the numbers $1, 2,$ and $3$ must be in different groups because two of them and any other digit 1-9 added together cannot produce 15 (For example, $2+3=5$ which means that we need a $10$ to sum to 15. In the same way, $7, 8,$ and $9$ cannot be placed in the same group because putting them in the same group would make the numbers greater than 15 (For example, $7+8=15$, meaning that it would be impossible to add another number with making the sum greater than 15.\nNow, we can just use trial and error to solve the problem (this is feasible because there are only $3*2=6$ ways to pair a number $1-3$ and $7-9$ and then add another number $4-6$ in order to sum to 15. By trial and error, we see that 1 and 7 must not be paired together because to have a sum of 15, there must be another 7 in the group (The problem only lets us use 1 of each number). This eliminates two of the options we are considering. Now, we only have to check the 4 options where 7 is not in a group with 1.By trial and error, we can see that only two cases work:1. $(1,8,6); (2,9,4); (3,7,5)$\nand\n2. $(1,9,5); (2,7,6); (3,8,4)$Because we only have two options, the answer is $B$",

To do this, we find the minimum of the last two: $241-20=221$, and the maximum\u2013 $250-13=237$. There is a difference of $13$ between them, so only $17$ and $18$ work, as $17\\cdot13=221$, so $17$ satisfies $221\\leq 13x\\leq237$. The number $18$ is similarly found. $19$, however, is too much.Now, we check with the first and last equations using the same method. We know $241-10\\leq 14x\\leq250-1$. Therefore, $231\\leq 14x\\leq249$. We test both values we just got, and we can realize that $18$ is too large to satisfy this inequality. On the other hand, we can now find that the difference will be $17$, which satisfies this inequality.The last step is to find the first term. We know that the first term can only be from $1$ to $3$ since any larger value would render the second inequality invalid. Testing these three, we find that only $a_1=3$ will satisfy all the inequalities. Therefore, $a_{14}=13\\cdot17+3=224$.
