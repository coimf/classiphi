Odd times even = even because odd numbers do not take away a factor of $2$, odd times odd = odd because no new factors of $2$ are introduced. (You can also use the $2n$ and $2k+1$ method.)The given of the solution, again, implies $a_n + a_{n-1} + \\dots + a_1$ is even. Since the parity of none of the terms change if you multiply the coefficients $a_i$ by $m^i$, the sum of all of the terms stays even. Adding $a_0$ to $a_n m^n + a_{n-1} m^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 m^1$ will make this sum odd, and since $0$ is an even number, this is a contradiction.~jasminelover7254"]}, "1972_usamo_problems/problem_4": {"id": {"year": 1972, "contest_name": "USAMO", "problem_number": 4}, "title": "1972 USAMO Problems/Problem 4", "problem": "Let $R$ denote a non-negative rational number.

Thus $f(ab)$ with $b = f(c)$ $\\leftrightarrow$ $c = \\frac{1}{f(b)}$ expands into $f(af(c)) = \\frac{f(a)}{c} = f(a)f(b)$.Utilizing $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$ we can see that if we break-down every ratio into it's prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. Our \"4-chain\" is simply $f(p) = q$, $f(q) = \\frac{1}{p}$, $f(\\frac{1}{p}) = \\frac{1}{q}$, $f(\\frac{1}{q}) = p$ where $p$ and $q$ are unique primes. Thus our 2 sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ is simply 2 sets of equal size containing only primes and their inverse. A good way to do this assuming we aren't given the sequence of all infinite primes (as this would require an explicit formula that does not yet exist) is to split the primes into 2 and 1 mod 6 being in one set with 3 and 5 mod 6 in the other. These sets have equal sizes from a strong form of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.Thus we have created our two sets and to show that this actually works we will let $x = P_1^{E_{1x}} \\times P_2^{E_{2x}} \\times P_3^{E_{3x}} \\times \\dots$ where $P_i$ is a prime and $E_{ix}$ are integers. Define $y$ similarly. For the sake of simplicity if $i$ is odd then $P_i \\in S_1$ and if $i$ is even $P_i \\in S_2$. Where our \"4-chain\" is $f(p_n) = p_{n+1}$, $f(p_{n+1}) = \\frac{1}{p_n}$, $f(\\frac{1}{p_n}) = \\frac{1}{p_{n+1}}$, $f(\\frac{1}{p_{n+1}}) = p_n$ with $n$ being odd. Then $f(y) = P_2^{E_{1y}} \\times P_1^{-E_{2y}} \\times P_4^{E_{3y}} \\times P_3^{-E_{4y}}\\dots$ (remember $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$ ).Then $xf(y) = P_1^{E_{1x} - E_{2y}} \\times P_2^{E_{2x} + E_{1y}} \\times P_3^{E_{3x} - E_{4y}} \\times \\dots$$f(xf(y)) = P_2^{E_{1x} - E_{2y}} \\times P_1^{-E_{2x} - E_{1y}} \\times P_4^{E_{3x} - E_{4y}} \\times P_3^{-E_{4x} - E_{3y}} \\dots$$f(x) = P_2^{E_{1x}} \\times P_1^{-E_{2x}} \\times P_4^{E_{3x}} \\times P_3^{-E_{4x}}\\dots$$\\frac{f(x)}{y} = P_2^{E_{1x}- E_{2y}} \\times P_1^{-E_{2x} - E_{1y}} \\times P_4^{E_{3x} - E_{4y}} \\times P_3^{-E_{4x} - E_{3y}}\\dots$Thus $f(xf(y)) = \\frac{f(x)}{y}$ QED", "We show first that f(1) = 1. Taking x = y = 1, we have f(f(1)) = f(1). Hence f(1) = f(f(1)) = f(1 f(f(1)) ) = f(1)/f(1) = 1.Next we show that f(xy) = f(x)f(y). For any y we have 1 = f(1) = f(1/f(y) f(y)) = f(1/f(y))/y, so if z = 1/f(y) then f(z) = y. Hence f(xy) = f(xf(z)) = f(x)/z = f(x) f(y).Finally, f(f(x)) = f(1 f(x)) = f(1)/x = 1/x.We are not required to find all functions, just one. So divide the primes into two infinite sets S = {p1, p2,... } and T= {q1, q2,... }. Define f(pn) = qn, and f(qn) = 1/pn. We extend this definition to all rationals using f(xy) = f(x) f(y): f(pi1pi2...qj1qj2.../(pk1...qm1...)) = pm1...qi1.../(pj1...qk1...).

To show this, we consider all $x$ and find solutions $n$.Before we consider solutions, we show that for all $x$, $f_n(x)$ is positive for all positive integers $n$ by induction. For our base case:\n\n\\[f_1(x)=\\sqrt{x^2+48}\\ge\\sqrt{48}>0\\]\n\nso it is positive. Next, for our inductive step, assume for some $n=k-1$ that $f_{k-1}(x)$ is positive; thus $f_{k-1}(x)>0$, and we show that $f_k(x)$ is positive:\n\n\\[f_k(x)=\\sqrt{x^2+6f_{k-1}(x)}\\ge\\sqrt{0+6f_{k-1}(x)}>\\sqrt{0+0}=0\\]\n\nthus $f_k(x)>0$, so we have proven the claim by induction.First, we consider negative $x$. We know that for negative $x$, if the equation were to have a solution, we would have $f_n(x)=2x<0$ for some $n$. However, $f_n(x)$ is always nonnegative since $f_n(x)$ is always the square root of some number, which can never be negative; thus there are no solutions in this case.Next, we consider $x=0$. Solutions would have to satisfy $f_n(0)=0$ ; we have previously shown that all $f_n(x)$ are positive, so there are no such $n$.Finally, we consider positive $x$. We divide this set into three groups: $x<4$, $x=4$, and $x>4$. We claim that for increasing $n$, $f_n(x)$ is decreasing, constant, and increasing, respectively, and we prove this using induction. First, we analyze $x<4$. Then\n\n\\[f_1(x)<\\sqrt{4^2+48}=\\sqrt{64}=8\\]\n\nFor our base case:\n\n\\[f_2(x)=\\sqrt{x^2+6f_1(x)}<\\sqrt{x^2+6\\cdot8}=f_1(x)\\]\n\nThus $f_2(x)<f_1(x)$.

Notice that in this case, the equation we must solve becomes $f_n(4)=8$, which is true for all positive integers $n$.Finally, we analyze $x>4$. Then\n\n\\[f_1(x)>\\sqrt{4^2+48}=\\sqrt{64}=8\\]\n\nFor our base case:\n\n\\[f_2(x)=\\sqrt{x^2+6f_1(x)}>\\sqrt{x^2+6\\cdot8}=f_1(x)\\]\n\nThus $f_2(x)>f_1(x)$.

Also, we know that $\\sin 90 = 1$. Thus $90 \\sin 90 = 90$. So we will use all these when we further simplify. Another thing that we can simplify is to notice that when we reach the term $92\\sin 88^\\circ$, we can rewrite it as $92\\sin 92^\\circ$. Thus we can rewrite everything in the form $x\\sin y^\\circ$ as $x \\sin x^\\circ$, starting with the term $92\\sin 88^\\circ$, then $94\\sin 86^\\circ$, and so on.Thus we can further simplify our equation.

(8)\\]Now we can use our product of sines to sum formula and see if we can find a pattern.We will start with expanding $(\\sin 1^\\circ)(2 \\sin 2^\\circ)$. Because the format of our formula for the product of sines is $\\sin \\alpha + \\sin \\beta$, we can factor out the $2$ and find the product, then multiply by $2$. So, we are at $2(\\sin 1^\\circ)(\\sin 2^\\circ)$. Our formula for the product of sines is $\\sin \\alpha + \\sin \\beta = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(\\alpha - \\beta) - \\cos(\\alpha + \\beta)]$. Plugging in our values into the formula and simplifying gives us $2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\cos 1^\\circ - \\cos 3^\\circ)\\right)$. We know that $2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ will just cancel out to $1$. So we are left with $\\cos 1^\\circ - \\cos 3^\\circ$. $(9)$Next we expand $(\\sin 1^\\circ)(2\\sin 4^\\circ)$. We use the same steps or strategy as we did above and get $\\cos 3^\\circ - \\cos 5^\\circ$. $(10)$We may be noticing a pattern. Just to make sure it is true, we will expand $(\\sin 1^\\circ)(2\\sin 6^\\circ)$. When we expand this using the same strategy above, we get $\\cos 5^\\circ - \\cos 7^\\circ$. $(11)$ So our pattern is that $(\\sin 1^\\circ)(2\\sin \\mu^\\circ) = \\cos (\\mu-1)^\\circ - \\cos (\\mu+1)^\\circ. (12)$Now we notice that when we add $(9)$ and $(10)$, $-\\cos 3^\\circ$ and $+\\cos 3^\\circ$ cancel themselves out to just $\\cos 1^\\circ - \\cos 5^\\circ$. Then, when we add $(11)$ to it, $+ \\cos 5^\\circ$ and $- \\cos 5^\\circ$ also cancel themselves out.Now, we need to figure out when we should stop canceling out. We can use formula $(12)$ and replace $88$ with $\\mu$ since $88$ is the last one in $(8)$. Applying this formula and simplifying gives us $\\cos 87^\\circ - \\cos 89$, so the last term would be $- \\cos 89$.Thus we know that everything we cancel themselves out except the first and the last term. So, we are left with\n\n\\[(\\cos 1^\\circ - \\cos 89^\\circ) + \\sin 1^\\circ = \\cos 1^\\circ. (13)\\]Now we notice that we have $\\cos 1^\\circ$ on both sides. Thus we can subtract $\\cos 1^\\circ$ from both sides to get $- \\cos 89^\\circ + \\sin 1^\\circ = 0$. Now we can add $\\cos 89^\\circ$ to both sides and get $\\sin 1^\\circ = \\cos 89^\\circ$. Now we also know that $\\sin (\\omega)^\\circ = \\cos(90-\\omega)$. Thus we know that $\\sin 1^\\circ = \\cos 89^\\circ$.

By the given lower bound, we know that\n\n\\[a_n\\ge a_{n-1}+a_1\\ge (a_{n-2}+a_1)+a_1\\ge \\cdots \\ge na_1.\\]\n\nTherefore, $na_1\\le a_n<a_n+1$, so the hypothesis is true for $k=1$. If $n=1$, then we wish to prove that $a_k < k(a_1+1)$. By the given upper bound, we know that\n\n\\[a_k\\le a_{k-1}+(a_1+1)\\le (a_{k-2}+(a_1+1))+(a_1+1)\\le\\cdots\\le ka_1+(k-1).\\]\n\nTherefore, $a_k<ka_1+k=k(a_1+1)$, so the hypothesis is true for $n=1$.Now suppose that (2) holds for all $k,n<j$. If $k=n=j$, then (2) is equivalent to $0<j$, which is obviously true. If $n=j>k$, then by the division algorithm, we can write $n=qk+r$ for nonnegative integers $q$ and $r$ with $0\\le r<k$. Thus by applying the lower bound repeatedly (with one of the indices equal to $1$ ), we find\n\n\\[k(a_n+1)\\ge k(qa_k+a_r+1)=kqa_k+k(a_r+1).\\tag{3}\\]\n\nBut then as $k,r<j$, we can apply the inductive hypothesis with $n=r$ and $k=k$ to find $k(a_r+1)> ra_k$. Substituting this into (3), we find\n\n\\[k(a_n+1)> kqa_k+ra_k=(kq+r)a_k=na_k.\\]\n\nThis proves the hypothesis for $n=j>k$.Suppose that $k=j>n$. Then by the division algorithm, we can write $k=qn+r$ for nonnegative integers $q$ and $r$ with $0\\le r<n$. Then by applying the upper bound repeatedly (with one of the indices equal to $1$ ), we find\n\n\\[na_k\\le n(qa_n+a_r+q)=nqa_n+na_r+nq.\\tag{4}\\]\n\nBut as $n,r<j$, we can apply the inductive hypothesis with $n=n$ and $k=r$, finding that $na_r< r(a_n+1)$. Subsituting this into (4), we find\n\n\\[na_k< nqa_n+r(a_n+1)+nq=(nq+r)(a_n+1)=k(a_n+1).\\]\n\nThis proves the hypothesis for $k=j>n$.Therefore, if the hypothesis is true for all $k,n<j$, then it must be true for all $k,n\\le j$. Hence by induction, it must be true for all positive integers $k$ and $n$. $\\hfill\\ensuremath{\\square}$Now suppose for the sake of contradiction that $I_n$ and $I_k$ are disjoint intervals. Without loss of generality, we may assume that $I_n$ precedes $I_k$ on the number line. Hence the upper bound of $I_n$ is less than or equal to the minimum value of $I_k$, or rather\n\n\\[\\frac{a_{n}+1}{n}\\le \\frac{a_k}{k}.\\]\n\nThis simplifies to $na_k\\ge k(a_n+1)$. But this contradicts the statement of Lemma 1. Therefore, $I_k\\cap I_n\\ne \\emptyset$.Now we claim that $I_1\\cap I_2\\cap \\cdots \\cap I_{1997}\\ne \\emptyset$. We prove this by induction. By the above, we know that $I_1\\cap I_2\\ne \\emptyset$. Now suppose that $I_1\\cap I_2\\cap\\cdots\\cap I_k\\ne \\emptyset$. The intersection of two overlapping intervals of the form $[a,b)$ and $[c,d)$ is an interval of the form $[e,f)$, where $e=\\max\\{a,c\\}$ and $f=\\min\\{b,d\\}$. Therefore, by induction, we know that if the intersection of $k$ overlapping intervals is nonempty, then it must also be an interval, say\n\n\\[I_1\\cap I_2\\cap\\cdots\\cap I_k=[x_k,y_k).\\]\n\nIf $I_{k+1}$ does not intersect $[x_k,y_k)$, then as an interval, it must appear either completely before $x_k$ or completely after $y_k$. If $I_{k+1}$ appears completely before $x_k$, then it has a nonempty intersection with each of $I_1, I_2, \\dots, I_k$. But we also know that $x_k$ is a lower bound of one of the intervals, hence $I_{k+1}$ cannot intersect that interval, a contradiction. A similar contradiction arises if $I_{k+1}$ appears completely after $y_k$. Therefore,\n\n\\[I_1\\cap I_2\\cap\\cdots\\cap I_{k+1}\\ne \\emptyset.\\]\n\nThus by induction, $I_1\\cap I_2\\cap\\cdots\\cap I_{1997}\\ne \\emptyset$. So let $x\\in I_1\\cap I_2\\cap\\cdots\\cap I_{1997}$.

That means the graph of F never becomes smooth near the diagonal.But every differentiable real-valued function f produces a smooth symmetric average F.

The equation is a circle, and from the bounds, the only solutions are $(0,0),(0,a),(a,0),(a,a)$. It seems as if the solution to the set involves only $0$ and $a$. To prove this, we need to prove that solutions involving only $0$ and $a$ would work and that no other solutions are possible.For the first part, we can use induction. The base case is already covered since the solutions for $i = 1$ are $x_1 = 0$ or $x_1 = a$. For the inductive step, assume that $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i^2+(a-x_i)^2)= na^2$, where $x_i = 0$ or $x_i = a$ for integer values of $i$. If $x_{i+1} = 0$, then $x_{i+1}^2+(a-x_{i+1})^2 = a^2$, and if $x_{i+1} = a$, then $x_{i+1}^2+(a-x_{i+1})^2 = a^2$. Thus, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i^2+(a-x_i)^2) + x_{i+1}^2+(a-x_{i+1})^2 = (n+1)a^2$. The inductive step holds, so solutions are all ordered pairs $(x_1, x_2, \\cdots x_n)$ where $x_i = 0$ or $x_i = a$ for integer values of $i$.For the second part, note that we can complete the square for $x_i$ to get $(x_1 - \\tfrac{a}{2})^2 + (x_2 - \\tfrac{a}{2})^2 + \\cdots (x_n - \\tfrac{a}{2})^2 = \\tfrac{na^2}{4}$.

Since no jumps after $a_n$ will land on an element in $M$ by the construction, the grasshopper must then land on an element $m_y > m_1$ in $M$ after making the jump $a_n$. However, this would imply that the original construction would land on another element $m_y$ different from $m_1$, but this is a contradiction.

The base case is simple, as plugging $a=1$ into the second equation given within the problem gives $f(1)=f(1)^2$. Since $f(n)$ can only return a positive integer value, we have that $f(1)=1$.Now we proceed with the inductive step. If the next number $n$ is either a perfect square or can be represented as a sum of two perfect squares, then obviously $f(n)=1$, as it is either the product of two $f$ -values that are both equal to $1$ from the inductive assumption or is the square of an $f$ -value that is equal to $1$, again due to the inductive assumption. Otherwise, we can use the Sum of Two Squares Theorem, which tells us that $n$ has at least one prime in its prime factorization that is $3(\\mod 4)$ and is raised to an odd power.Lemma 1: Given that $a^2+b^2=c^2$ and $f(b)=f(c)=1$, we then have $f(a)=1$.Proof: Note that the first condition in the problem tells us that $f(a^2+b^2)=f(a)f(b)$, or $f(c^2)=f(a)f(b)$. Using the second condition gives us $f(c)^2=f(a)f(b)$. Plugging in the values of $f(b)$ and $f(c)$ gives us that $f(a)=1$.Now we will attempt to repeatedly remove prime factors that are $3(mod 4)$ and taken to an odd power, and we will move from the largest prime down to the smallest prime that satisfies above conditions. The prime factors will be removed by constructing a Pythagorean Triple with the prime being the smallest leg in the form of $p,\\frac{p^2-1}{2},\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$ (this will always work as $p\\neq 2$ (not 3 mod 4), and this method works via Lemma 1). We will then prove the ending numbers that we achieve via removing all the $(\\text{mod } 4)$ primes(which I will refer to as \"tips\") are equal to 1 b/c they can be expressed as the sum of two squares or is a perfect square(Sum of Two Squares Theorem). For example, if we took the number $21$, we would first aim to remove the $7$ by splitting it into $24$ and $25$, so $21$ would become $72$ and $75$. $75$ is divisible by $3$ to an odd power, so we transform it into $100$ and $125$. These two don't have any divisors that are $3 (\\text{mod } 4)$ raised to an odd power so we leave it alone, as sum of two squares will work on them or they are perfect squares. $72$ does have a prime factor that is $3(\\text{mod } 4)$, but it is an even power so we leave it alone. In this case, the tips are $72$, $100$, and $125$. However, now we need to prove two key facts: using this Pythagorean Triple Method will never generate another $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ prime that is bigger than the current one we are working on or create more primes or keep the same number of primes in the tips' prime factorizations., as otherwise it could cause an infinite cycle, and also we must prove when we use Sum of Two Squares/Perfect Square given in the second condition on the tips the square root of the square(s) used will never be greater than or equal to $n$.The first claim can be proved rather simply. Note that $\\frac{p^2-1}{2}$ can have no prime factors greater than or equal to $p$, as it can be factored as $(p-1)(\\frac{p+1}{2})$, which are both less than $p$ and are integers( $p+1$ must be an integer due to $p$ must being odd(not equal to $2$ )). For $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$, we can prove something a bit more general.Lemma 2: For any positive integer $n$, all prime factors of $n^2+1$ must be $1(\\text{mod } 4)$.Proof: Note that if $n^2+1\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$, then we also must have $(n^2+1)(n^2-1)=(n^4-1)\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$, or $n^4 \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$. Now we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem to obtain $n^{p-1}\\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$. Note that since $n$ and $n^2$ are obviously not $1(\\text{mod } p)$, as $n^2\\equiv -1 (\\text{mod } p)$, we have that $p-1$ is a multiple of $4$, or $p \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } 4)$.We can simply apply Lemma 2 to $p^2+1$ as $2$ is obviously not $3(\\text{mod } 4)$, and this means that a prime factor $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ will never be generated from this term. This completes the first of our two claims.Now we proceed to the second of our two claims. Note that every time we use the method on $n$ based on prime $p$, we will multiply by around $\\frac{p}{2}$, clearly less than $p$ (if we multiply by $p$ we would get $p^2$ which is clearly greater than $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$ ). We will never have to use the same prime twice in our method, so at max in the end we will multiply $n$ by the product of a little less than all $3(mod 4)$ primes that divide it, which is less than $n$ itself for $n$ greater than or equal to $3$ (the smallest 3 mod 4 prime), meaning that the largest number that we must use two squares on that is generated by out method is less than $n^2$. We need to prove that the two squares that sum to this are both less than $n$, which is quite trivial, as they are less than $\\sqrt{n^2}$, which obviously means it must be less than $n$. This proves the second of our claims.This completes the second case of the inductive step, and therefore completes both the induction and the problem.\n~Solution by hyxue", "The Answer is $\\boxed{f\\equiv 1}$ which works but we want to prove that it's the only one.
