For example, we can't really do anything without knowing how many squares there are in the 37th row. But who wants to continue the diagram for 37 rows? And what if the problem said 100,000th row? It'll still be possible - but not if your method is to continue the diagram...So hopefully there's a pattern. We find a pattern by noticing what is changing from row 1 to row 2. Basically, for the next row, we are just adding 2 squares (1 on each side) to the number of squares we had in the previous row. So each time we're adding 2. So how can we find $N$, if $N$ is the number of squares in the $a^\\text{th}$ row of this diagram? We can't just say that $N = 1 + 2a$, because it doesn't work for the first row. But since 1 is the first term, we have to EXCLUDE the first term, meaning that we must subtract 1 from a. Thus, $N = 1 + 2\\times(a - 1) = 2a - 1$. So in the 37th row we will have $2 \\times 37 - 1 = 74 - 1 = 73$.You may now be thinking - aha, we're finished. But we're only half finished. We still need to find how many black squares there are in these 73 squares. Well let's see - they alternate white-black-white-black... but we can't divide by two - there aren't exactly as many white squares as black squares... there's always 1 more white square... aha! If we subtract 1 from the number of squares (1 white square), we will have exactly 2 times the number of black squares.Thus, the number of black squares is $\\frac{73 - 1}{2} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36$36 is $\\boxed{\\text{C}}$", "Note that each row adds one black and one white square to the end of the previous one, and then shifts the new row over a little.

In particular, this results in all the terms of the arithmetic sequence being $6+6 = 12$, and again as in Solution 1, the middle term must be the average of the $5$ terms, so it is necessarily $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 12}$.", "As the numbers $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ are $3$, $5$, $6$, $7$, and $9$ in some order, we deduce that the smallest term of the arithmetic sequence must be at least $3 + 5 = 8$, while the largest term must be at most $7 + 9 = 16$.Thus, as this sequence has $5$ terms, its common difference $d$ is at most $\\frac{16-8}{5-1} = 2$.But as $d$ is positive (taking the arithmetic sequence in increasing order without loss of generality) and an integer (since it is a difference of sums of integers), while exactly $2$ of the sums must be odd (since exactly $4$ of the numbers $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ are odd, while the $5$ th number is even), it follows that $d$ must be odd. Therefore, the only possibility is $d = 1$.Next, again noting that the sequence has exactly $2$ odd terms, and thus $5-2 = 3 > 2$ even terms, we observe that the middle term must have the majority parity, i.e. must be even. This means the $2$ terms adjacent to the middle term must be odd, and therefore must be $(6+a)$ and $(6+b)$ with $a,b \\in \\{3,5,7,9\\}$. Moreover, $(6+a)-(6-b) = a-b$ is exactly twice the common difference, i.e. $2d = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.The only other observation we need is that $a$ and $b$ can't be the smallest, or largest, $2$ odd numbers, because that would make it impossible to construct the smallest, or (respectively) largest, sum from $1$ of the remaining $2$ even numbers and $1$ of the odd numbers. Together with $a-b = 2$ from above, this implies that $a = 5$ and $b = 7$, so finally, the middle term of the sequence must be $(6+5) + 1 = (6+7) - 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 12}$.(It is now easy to see that one possible solution is $A = 3$, $B = 9$, $C = 5$, $D = 6$, and $E = 7$ ; this gives the edge sums as $12$, $14$, $11$, $13$, and $10$, which indeed form the arithmetic sequence $10,11,12,13,14$.)~oinava"]}, "2005_amc_12a_problems/problem_1": {"id": {"year": 2005, "contest_name": "AMC 12A", "problem_number": 1}, "title": "2005 AMC 12A Problems/Problem 1", "problem": "Two is $10 \\%$ of $x$ and $20 \\%$ of $y$.

The two triangles are similar by SAS, with one triangle having side lengths $100$ times the other!Let $AD=x$. Then from our reasoning above, we have $AB=100x$.

Those two triangles are similar because $AD$ and $AB$ are perpendicular. $\\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{200}{2}$, so the area $AB \\cdot AD = \\frac {AB^2}{100} = \\frac {2000^2 + 200^2}{100} = \\boxed{40400 \\text{ (E)}}$In order to find the area of rectangle $ABCD$, we need to find $AB$ first.

Because all of them are integers, then we know that $AD$ has to also contain $\\sqrt{101}$ to ensure that $AB*AD$ is an integer. Once you know that, you can guarantee that the answer must be a multiple of 101. (If you're wondering why there can't be a fraction like $1/101$, there can't because $y$ is an integer the number under the square root in $AD$, is an integer.) Having that information narrows down the answer choices to just $(B)$ $4040$, and $(E)$ $40400$.Looking back at what we found for $AB$, which is $200\\sqrt{101}$, and what we know about $AD$, that it has to contain $\\sqrt{101}$. we know that the answer is at least $200\\sqrt{101}*\\sqrt{101}=20200$, which is already greater than answer choice $(B)$, which is $4040$.

Since there must be two $1$ s in each row and column, there must be exactly one $0$ in each row and column, making the number of distinct squares under this case defined by the number of distinct ways to place the three $0$ s.To start counting, we know that there is exactly one $0$ in the left column. If that $0$ is in the top row, there are two ways to place the other two $0$ s. If that $0$ is in the middle row, there are also two ways to place the other two $0$ s. Finally, if that $0$ is in the bottom row, there are still two ways to place the other two $0$ s.Thus, if there are no $2$ s present, there are $2+2+2=6$ configurations.Case Two: There is one $2$Wherever the $2$ is placed, the numbers in the same row and column as the $2$ must all be $0$ s to keep the sum of the numbers in that row and column at 2. This means that in the two other columns and two other rows that do not contain the $2$, one of their three total squares is occupied by a $0$, and they are not allowed to use a $2$, since the only $2$ in the square has already been placed. Thus, all the remaining squares that were not already filled with the one $2$ or the required $0$ s must now be filled with $1$ s to maintain the sum of 2 within every column and every row.Thus, counting the number of configurations here is simple, as it is entirely dependent on where the $2$ is placed. Since there are 9 places that the $2$ could occupy, there are $9$ possibilities for this case.Case Three: There are three $2$ sUsing the same logic we used for the case involving just one $2$, we can see that if there are three $2$ s, they must all be on separate rows and columns, and every other number in the grid must be a $0$.We can count the number of ways to place the three $2$ s in the same way we counted the number of ways to place the three $0$ s in Case One, meaning there are $6$ possibilities for this case.It should also be noted that it is impossible to have exactly two $2$ s within the square, because if there were, they would have to be on separate columns and rows. This would mean that, after the required $0$ s were filled in, only one square would be left unfilled, and the other two numbers in its row would both be $0$ s (the same goes for the other two numbers in its column), requiring that the last square also be filled with a $2$. Thus, if there are at least two $2$ s, there must also be a third $2$, meaning it is impossible to have exactly two $2$ s.Now that we've counted all the possible cases, all that's left is to add $6$ from the first case, $9$ from the second case, and $6$ from the third case to get $6 + 9 + 6 = \\boxed{21}$ total $3 \\times 3$ square arrays."]}, "2008_unco_math_contest_ii_problems/problem_1": {"id": {"year": 2008, "contest_name": "UNCO Math Contest II", "problem_number": 1}, "title": "2008 UNCO Math Contest II Problems/Problem 1", "problem": "Determine the number of $3 \\times 3$ square arrays\nwhose row and column sums are equal to $2$,\nusing $0, 1, 2$ as entries.

If we assume that $a < b < c < d$, it is obvious that $a + b = 5$ and $c + d = 19$, as those are the minimum and maximum pair-wise sums.

So, let's express the angle measures as multiples of $15$.Let $b_n = \\frac{\\arctan{(a_n)}}{15}$.(Basically, $b_n$ is the angle measure of the corresponding $a_n,$ divided by $15$ )Now we have$b_1 = 3$$b_2 = 2$$b_3 = 5$$b_4 = 7$$b_5 = 12$But wait... we're dealing with the $\\tan$ function, which has a period (recurrence rate) of $2\\pi$ or $180^{\\circ}$. Since we divided the angle measures by $15$, the period is now $12$ (which aligns with what we got earlier: $a_5 = 0$ ). This means that we can reduce the terms of the sequence based on the $\\bmod$ function, which returns the remainder after dividing by a certain amount. So now we can say $b_n \\equiv b_n \\bmod{12}$ ( $\\equiv$ denotes modular equivalence in this context). Now we continue our sequence:$3, 2, 5, 7, 0, 7, 7, 2, 9, 11, 8, 7, 3, 10, 1, 11, 0, 11, 11, 10, 9, 7, 4, 11, 3, 2, 5$ (It's starting to repeat now)So $a_1 = 3, a_{25} = 3, a_{49} = 3$, and so on. The sequence repeats every $24$ terms. The problem asks us for the value of $a_{2009}$. Let's whip out the $\\bmod$ function again.$2009 \\bmod 24 = 17$So we want the value of the $17$ th number in the sequence, and looking back at it (hopefully you wrote it down somewhere) we find that $b_{17} = 0 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{A}}$."]}, "2009_unco_math_contest_ii_problems/problem_1": {"id": {"year": 2009, "contest_name": "UNCO Math Contest II", "problem_number": 1}, "title": "2009 UNCO Math Contest II Problems/Problem 1", "problem": "How many positive $3$ -digit numbers $abc$ are there such that $a+b=c$ For example, $202$ and $178$\nhave this property but $245$ and $317$ do not.", "answer_choices": "frq", "answer": "", "solutions": ["Here, we need to find $a,b\\in \\Bbb N_0$ such that $1\\le a\\le 9$, $0\\le b\\le 9$ and $a+b=c$ where $c\\in \\Bbb N, c\\le 9$.If we place $a=1$, then we can place $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$ as $b$, i.e. in $9$ ways.Similarly, if we place $a=2$, we can place $b=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7$ i.e. in $8$ ways.\\[\\dots\\]If, we place $a=9$, we have the only choice $b=0$, in $2$ ways.So, in order to get the number of possibilities, we have to add the no. of all the possibilities we got, i.e. the answer is\n\n\\[\\color{red}{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=\\frac {9\\times 10}{2}}=\\color{blue}{45}\\]"]}, "2010_amc_12a_problems/problem_1": {"id": {"year": 2010, "contest_name": "AMC 12A", "problem_number": 1}, "title": "2010 AMC 12A Problems/Problem 1", "problem": "What is $\\left(20-\\left(2010-201\\right)\\right)+\\left(2010-\\left(201-20\\right)\\right)$?", "answer_choices": "$\\textbf{(A)}\\ -4020 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 0 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 40 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 401 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 4020$", "answer": "\\textbf{(C)}\\,40", "solutions": ["$20-2010+201+2010-201+20=20+20=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\,40}$."]}, "2010_amc_12a_problems/problem_10": {"id": {"year": 2010, "contest_name": "AMC 12A", "problem_number": 10}, "title": "2010 AMC 12A Problems/Problem 10", "problem": "The first four terms of an arithmetic sequence are $p$, $9$, $3p-q$, and $3p+q$.

Knowing this, if there are 10 shapes and you require 2 shapes to make a unit, 10 divided by 2 equals 5, which is the area.5 is 1/6 of 30(the total of the graph) and so the final answer is $\\frac{5}{30}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{1}{6}}$.\n-Themathnerd3.14"]}, "2015_amc_8_problems/problem_20": {"id": {"year": 2015, "contest_name": "AMC 8", "problem_number": 20}, "title": "2015 AMC 8 Problems/Problem 20", "problem": "Ralph went to the store and bought 12 pairs of socks for a total of $$24$.

If he bought at least one pair of each type, how many pairs of $$1$ socks did Ralph buy?", "answer_choices": "$\\textbf{(A) } 4 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 5 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 6 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 7 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 8$", "answer": "\\textbf{(D)}~7", "solutions": ["So, let there be $x$ pairs of $$1$ socks, $y$ pairs of $$3$ socks, and $z$ pairs of $$4$ socks.We have $x+y+z=12$, $x+3y+4z=24$, and $x,y,z \\ge 1$.Now, we subtract to find $2y+3z=12$, and $y,z \\ge 1$.\nIt follows that $2y$ is a multiple of $3$ and $3z$ is a multiple of $3$. Since sum of 2 multiples of 3 = multiple of 3, so we must have $2y=6$.Therefore, $y=3$, and it follows that $z=2$. Now, $x=12-y-z=12-3-2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~7}$, as desired.Since the total cost of the socks was $$24$ and Ralph bought $12$ pairs, the average cost of each pair of socks is $\\frac{$24}{12} = $2$.There are two ways to make packages of socks that average to $$2$. You can have:$\\bullet$ Two $$1$ pairs and one $$4$ pair (package adds up to $$6$ )$\\bullet$ One $$1$ pair and one $$3$ pair (package adds up to $$4$ )Now, we need to solve\n\n\\[6a+4b=24,\\]\n\nwhere $a$ is the number of $$6$ packages and $b$ is the number of $$4$ packages. We see our only solution (that has at least one of each pair of sock) is $a=2, b=3$, which yields the answer of $2\\times2+3\\times1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~7}$.Since there are 12 pairs of socks, and Ralph bought at least one pair of each, there are $12-3=9$ pairs of socks left. Also, the sum of the three pairs of socks is $1+3+4=8$. This means that there are $24-8=16$ dollars left. If there are only $1$ dollar socks left, then we would have $9\\cdot1=9$ dollars wasted, which leaves $7$ more dollars. If we replace one pair with a $3$ dollar pair, then we would waste an additional $2$ dollars. If we replace one pair with a $4$ dollar pair, then we would waste an additional $3$ dollars. The only way $7$ can be represented as a sum of $2$ s and $3$ s is $2+2+3$. If we change $3$ pairs, we would have $6$ pairs left. Adding the one pair from previously, we have $\\boxed{(\\text{D})~7}$ pairs.Let the amount of $1$ dollar socks be $a$, $3$ dollar socks be $b$, and $4$ dollar socks be $c$. We then know that $a+b+c=12$ and $a+3b+4c=24$. We can make $a+b+c=12$ into $a=12-b-c$ and then plug that into the other equation, producing $12-b-c+3b+4c=24$ which simplifies to $2b+3c=12$. It's not hard to see $b=3$ and $c=2$. Now that we know $b$ and $c$, we know that $a=7$, meaning the number of $1$ dollar socks Ralph bought is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 7}$.If Ralph bought one sock of each kind, he already used $$8$, so there are $$16$ left and 9 socks. If we split the $$16$ into four $$4$ sections, (as it is the smallest possible number that 1, 3, 4, can make in different ways that in all use at least each of the numbers once,) if Ralph bought a $$3$ pair, he would need to buy a $$1$ pair in order for it to add up to a multiple of four. Similarly, if Ralph bought a $$1$ pair, he would either need to buy three $$1$ pairs or a $$3$ pair. If Ralph bought a $$4$ pair, it would already make a group. Now, the problem is just how we can split 9 into 4 groups of 1, 2, or 4. We clearly see that $1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9$, or a $$4$ pair, two $$3$ pairs, and six $$1$ pairs. Because we subtracted the necessary one of each kind, there are two $$4$ pairs, three $$3$ pairs, and seven $$1$ pairs. Therefore, the number of $$1$ pairs Ralph bought is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~7}$.\n~strongstephenTo simplify the problem, we can reduce the price of each sock by $$1$, resulting in the prices being $$0$, $$2$ and $$3$. This means the total price Ralph spends becomes $$24-12\\times$1=$12$. Now the $$0$ socks aren't worth anything, but we still need to keep in mind there are at least one of them, so the question becomes: at most 11 of $$2$ and $$3$ socks add up to $$12$. It is obvious that $3\\times$2+2\\times$3=$12$, so the number of $$0$ socks (actually $$1$ socks) is $12-3-2=7$.Note: this is very similar to Solution 1, but a non algebraic way of thinking about it.-bbidev"]}, "2015_amc_8_problems/problem_23": {"id": {"year": 2015, "contest_name": "AMC 8", "problem_number": 23}, "title": "2015 AMC 8 Problems/Problem 23", "problem": "Tom has twelve slips of paper which he wants to put into five cups labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$.

Doing so, we see that $B$ looks like\n\n\\[\\underbrace{2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0,}_{\\text{cycle period}} 2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0, \\ldots\\]\n\n(If you tried pattern finding on sequence $B$ directly, you could also arrive at this result, although I figured defining a second sequence based on finite differences was more motivated.)Now, there are two ways to finish.Finish Method #1: Notice that any six consecutive terms of $B$ sum to $6,$ after which we see that $a_n = a_{n-6} + 6.$ Therefore, $a_{2018} = a_{2012} + 6 = \\cdots = a_{2} + 2016 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$Finish Method #2: Notice that $a_{2018} = a_{2017} - a_{2016} + 2018 = B_{2016} + 2018 = -1 + 2018 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$~Professor-Mom", "Start out by listing some terms of the sequence.\n\n\\begin{align*} f(1)&=1 \\\\ f(2)&=1 \\\\ f(3)&=3 \\\\ f(4)&=6 \\\\ f(5)&=8 \\\\ f(6)&=8 \\\\ f(7)&=7 \\\\ f(8)&=7 \\\\ f(9)&=9 \\\\ f(10)&=12 \\\\ f(11)&=14 \\\\ f(12)&=14 \\\\ f(13)&=13 \\\\ f(14)&=13 \\\\ f(15)&=15 \\\\ & \\ \\vdots \\end{align*}\n\nNotice that $f(n)=n$ whenever $n$ is an odd multiple of $3$, and the pattern of numbers that follow will always be $+3$, $+2$, $+0$, $-1$, $+0$, $+2$.\nThe largest odd multiple of $3$ smaller than $2018$ is $2013$, so we have\n\n\\begin{align*} f(2013)&=2013 \\\\ f(2014)&=2016 \\\\ f(2015)&=2018 \\\\ f(2016)&=2018 \\\\ f(2017)&=2017 \\\\ f(2018)&=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}. \\end{align*}", "Writing out the first few values, we get\n\n\\[1,1,3,6,8,8,7,7,9,12,14,14,13,13,15,18,20,20,19,19,\\ldots.\\]\n\nWe see that every number $x$ where $x \\equiv 1\\pmod 6$ has $f(x)=x,f(x+1)=f(x)=x,$ and $f(x-1)=f(x-2)=x+1.$ The greatest number that's $1\\pmod{6}$ and less than $2018$ is $2017,$ so we have $f(2017)=f(2018)=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$", "\\begin{align*} f(n)&=f(n-1)-f(n-2)+n \\\\ f(n-1)&=f(n-2)-f(n-3)+n-1 \\end{align*}\n\nSubtracting those two and rearranging gives\n\n\\begin{align*} f(n)-2f(n-1)+2f(n-2)-f(n-3)&=1 \\\\ f(n-1)-2f(n-2)+2f(n-3)-f(n-4)&=1 \\end{align*}\n\nSubtracting those two gives $f(n)-3f(n-1)+4f(n-2)-3f(n-3)+f(n-4)=0.$The characteristic polynomial is $x^4-3x^3+4x^2-3x+1=0.$$x=1$ is a root, so using synthetic division results in $(x-1)(x^3-2x^2+2x-1)=0.$$x=1$ is a root, so using synthetic division results in $(x-1)^2(x^2-x+1)=0.$$x^2-x+1=0$ has roots $x=\\frac{1}{2}\\pm\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}.$And\n\n\\[f(n)=(An+D)\\cdot1^n+B\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^n+C\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^n.\\]\n\nPlugging in $n=1$, $n=2$, $n=3$, and $n=4$ results in a system of $4$ linear equations $\\newline$\nSolving them gives $A=1, \\ B=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\ C=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\ D=1.$ Note that you can guess $A=1$ by answer choices.So plugging in $n=2018$ results in\n\n\\begin{align*} 2018+1+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^{2019}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^{2019}&=2019+(\\cos(-60^{\\circ})+\\sin(-60^{\\circ}))^{2019})+(\\cos(60^{\\circ})+\\sin(60^{\\circ}))^{2019}) \\\\ &=2019+(\\cos(-60^{\\circ}\\cdot2019)+\\sin(-60^{\\circ}\\cdot2019))+(\\cos(60^{\\circ}\\cdot2019)+sin(60^{\\circ}\\cdot2019)) \\\\ &=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}. \\end{align*}\n\n~ryanbear", "We utilize patterns to solve this equation:\n\n\\begin{align*} f(3)&=3, \\\\ f(4)&=6, \\\\ f(5)&=8, \\\\ f(6)&=8, \\\\ f(7)&=7, \\\\ f(8)&=8. \\end{align*}\n\nWe realize that the pattern repeats itself.

Plot the rectangle on the Cartesian plane at the vertices $(0,0),(p,0),(q,p),(0,q).$ The diagonal has endpoints at $(0,0),(q,p)$, so its slope is $\\frac{p}{q}.$ Now, suppose the diagonal goes through the corner point $(a,b)$, where $a<q$ and $b<p$. The slope of this line is $\\frac{b}{a}$, which must be equal to $\\frac{p}{q},$ implying that $\\frac{p}{q}$ can be reduced, contradicting the fact that $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime. We conclude that no corner points of a grid entry (unit square) are crossed. \\\\\\\\\nSince no corner points are crossed, each time the diagonal crosses either a horizontal or vertical grid line, exactly one more unit square is touched by the diagonal. There are $p-1$ horizontal lines and $q-1$ vertical lines, so there are $p + q - 2$ total lines crossed by the diagonal. This doesn't include the square in the bottom left corner, crossed initially. Therefore, there are $p + q-2 + 1 = p + q - 1$ unit squares crossed by the diagonal and our claim is proven.$\\textbf{Lemma 2 for Problem 23:}$Let $p$ and $q$ be positive integers.

However, $x = y$ in these solutions.Substitute $y = x(x-4)$ into $x = y(y-4)$.This gives the equation$x = x(x-4)(x^2-4x-4)$which can be simplified to$x(x^3 - 8x^2 +12x + 15) = 0$.Knowing $x = 0$ and $x = 5$ are solutions is now helpful, as you divide both sides by $x(x-5)$. This can also be done using polynomial division to find $x = 5$ as a factor. This gives$x^2 - 3x -3 = 0$.Because the two equations $x = y(y-4)$ and $y = x(x-4)$ are symmetric, the $x$ and $y$ values are the roots of the equation, which are $x = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{21}}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{21}}{2}$.Squaring these and adding them together gives$\\frac{3^2 + 21 + 6\\sqrt{21}}{4} + \\frac{3^2 + 21 - 6\\sqrt{21}}{4} = \\frac{2(3^2 +21)}{4} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$.Note that $x^2+y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy$.

Do not use this method unless you're sure about the answer. In other words, this solution is less reliable than the others, so only use it if you can't do the other methods.This, by the way, is a really cheap way of solving the problem but as long as you get an answer, it doesn't matter.Looking at the first given equation, begin searching for solutions. Notice how $(4,0)$ works but when plugged into thesecond equation, you get $8=4$. Now, if you decrease the $y$ value by $1$ to obtain $(2+\\sqrt3,-1)$, plugging it intothe second equation will yield $6+\\sqrt3=9$. Now, notice how the LHS is now less than the RHS as opposed to what it hadbeen when we plugged $(4,0)$ into the second given equation. We then conclude that there must be a solution between$y=0$ and $y=-1$, so calculating $x^2+y^2$ of $(4,0)$ and $(2+\\sqrt3,-1)$ we obtain\\[4^2+0^2=16\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[(2+\\sqrt3)^2+(-1)^2=8+4\\sqrt3\\approx14.9\\]Thus we know the answer to be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$.This is a really bad solution, but it works.\u00a0:/Note: In this solution, I explain my entire thought process and the reason why I did each step, so you can read a more intuitive solution rather than a contrived one.We first notice that each equation has a $4$, which inspires us to isolate the $4$ on both equations and equate them to see if we can gather any useful information on $x$ and $y.$Doing this we get $(x-2)^2-y = (y-2)^2- x.$ Now you might be tempted to expand, but notice how we have two perfect squares in our equation: $(x-2)^2$ and $(y-2)^2,$ which motivates us to take advantage of the difference of squares.\nFor simplicity, we suppose that $(x-2) = a$ and $(y-2) = b.$ Thus our equation is now $a^2-y = b^2-x.$ We manipulate this equation by getting the LHS in a form that lets us do difference of squares, so we can rewrite as $a^2-b^2 = -(x-y).$Now we can finally use our difference of squares to get $(a-b)(a+b) = -(x-y).$Let's now substitute $a$ and $b$ back to get information solely for $x$ and $y.$Doing this we get, $(x-y)(x+y-4) = -(x-y).$Now let us divide $x-y$ on both sides and clean up the equation. When we do this, we get that $x+y = 3.$We got $x+y = 3,$ which means that this is fact is only of use if we can obtain it in another way, so we add the LHS and the RHS of both equations and equate them to make our fact of essence.Doing that, we get $x+y +8 = (x-2)^2+ (y-2)^2.$ Also, when we set this equation up we not only do we make our fact useful, but we also can see that after expanding the RHS, we get $x^2+y^2$ on the RHS too, which makes it even a better move that we added both equations because remember our goal is to find $x^2+y^2.$Expanding and plugging in $x+y = 3$ we get $11 = x^2+y^2-4(x+y)+8.$ $x+y=3,$ so we can plug that in and we get $x^2+y^2 = 15$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$ after cleaning up some algebra.~triggodSubtract the two equations to get $(x-y)= (x+y-4)(y-x) \\iff x+y=3$. Plugging back into any of the original equations yields $x^2-3x=3$. However, we know $x^2+y^2= x^2+(3-x)^2= 2x^2-6x+9$. Then, we can just multiply the first by two and add $9$ to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$"]}, "2018_amc_10a_problems/problem_8": {"id": {"year": 2018, "contest_name": "AMC 10A", "problem_number": 8}, "title": "2018 AMC 10A Problems/Problem 8", "problem": "Joe has a collection of $23$ coins, consisting of $5$ -cent coins, $10$ -cent coins, and $25$ -cent coins.
