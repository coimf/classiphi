By Heron's Formula, the area of this triangle is $84.$ Thus the height perpendicular to $AB$ has a length of $11.2,$ and by the Pythagorean Theorem, $AE$ and $EB$ have lengths $6.6$ and $8.4,$ respectively. These lengths tell us that $C$ is at $(6.6,11.2)$.The slope of $BC$ is $\\dfrac{0-11.2}{15-6.6}=-\\dfrac{4}{3},$ and the slope of $AD$ is $\\dfrac{3}{4}$ by taking the negative reciprocal of $-\\dfrac{4}{3}.$ Therefore, the equation of line $AD$ can best be represented by $y=\\dfrac{3}{4}x.$We next find the intersection of $CE$ and $AD$. We automatically know the $x$ -value; it is just $6.6$ because $CE$ is a straight line hitting $(6.6,0).$ Therefore, the $y$ -value is at $\\dfrac{3}{4}\\times 6.6=4.95.$ Therefore, the intersection between $CE$ and $AD$ is at $(6.6,4.95)$.We also need to find the intersection between $BC$ and $AD$. To do that, we know that the line of $AD$ is represented as $y=\\dfrac{3}{4}x,$ and the slope of line $BC$ is $-\\dfrac{4}{3}.$ We just need to find line $BC$ 's y-intercept. So far, we have $y=-\\dfrac{4}{3}x+b,$ where $b$ is a real y-intercept. We know that $B$ is located at $(15,0),$ so we plug that into the equation and yield $b=20.$ Therefore, the intersection between the two lines is\n\n\\[\\dfrac{3}{4}x=-\\dfrac{4}{3}x+20, 9x=-16x+240, 25x=240, x=9.6, y=\\dfrac{3}{4}\\times 9.6, y=7.2.\\]\n\nAfter that, we use the distance formula: $HA$ has a length of\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(6.6-0)^2+(4.95-0)^2}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1089}{25}+\\dfrac{9801}{400}}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1089*16+9801}{400}}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{27225}{400}}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1089}{16}}=\\dfrac{33}{4}=8.25,\\]\n\nand $HD$ has a length of\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(9.6-6.6)^2+(7.2-4.95)^2}=\\sqrt{3^2+(\\dfrac{36}{5}-\\dfrac{99}{20})^2}=\\sqrt{9+\\dfrac{81}{16}}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{225}{16}}=3.75.\\]\n\nThus, we have that $\\dfrac{3.75}{8.25}=\\dfrac{\\frac{15}{4}}{\\frac{33}{4}}=\\dfrac{15}{33}=\\dfrac{5}{11}=\\boxed{\\bold{B}}.$ -OreoChocolate",

      "An equilateral triangle is isosceles, and we find that $\\angle A=\\angle B=\\angle C$ if we use the property of isosceles triangles that if two sides of a triangle are equal then the opposite angles are equal. Thus equilateral triangles are equiangular, and $C$ is true.Regular polygons are both equilateral and equiangular, and so are equilateral triangles are both equilateral (by definition) and equiangular (by the above argument). Thus equilateral triangles are regular polygons and $D$ is true.Since all of the angles in an equilateral triangle are congruent, all equilateral triangles are similar by AAA similarity. Thus, $E$ is true.Since $\\angle A=\\angle B=\\angle C$ and $\\angle A+\\angle B+\\angle C=180$, $\\angle A=60^{\\circ}$. Since no other angles are above $180^{\\circ}$, all equilateral triangles are convex. Thus, $B$ is true.This just leaves choice $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(A)}}$.

Hence we get the following two equations:\\begin{align*} s^2 + (1-r)^2 & = (1+r)^2 \\\\ (4-s)^2 + (4-r)^2 & = (4+r)^2 \\end{align*}Simplifying both, we get\\begin{align*} s^2 & = 4r \\\\ (4-s)^2 & = 16r \\end{align*}As in our case both $r$ and $s$ are positive, we can divide the second one by the first one to get $\\left( \\frac{4-s}s \\right)^2 = 4$.Now there are two possibilities: either $\\frac{4-s}s=-2$, or $\\frac{4-s}s=2$.In the first case clearly $s<0$, which puts the center on the wrong side of $A$, so this is not the correct case.(Note: This case corresponds to the other circle that is tangent to both given circles and the common tangent line. By coincidence, due to the $4:1$ ratio between radii of $A$ and $B$, this circle turns out to have the same radius as circle $B$, with center directly left of center $B$, and tangent to $B$ directly above center $A$.)The second case solves to $s=\\frac 43$. We then have $4r = s^2 = \\frac {16}9$, hence $r = \\boxed{\\frac 49}$.More generally, for two large circles of radius $a$ and $b$, the radius $c$ of the small circle is $c = \\frac{ab}{\\left(\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1/\\sqrt{a}+1/\\sqrt{b}\\right)^2}$.Equivalently, we have that $1/\\sqrt{c} = 1/\\sqrt{a} + 1/\\sqrt{b}$.The horizontal line is the equivalent of a circle of curvature $0$, thus we can apply Descartes' Circle Formula.The four circles have curvatures $0, 1, \\frac 14$, and $\\frac 1r$.We have $2\\left(0^2+1^2+\\frac {1}{4^2}+\\frac{1}{r^2}\\right)=\\left(0+1+\\frac 14+\\frac 1r\\right)^2$Simplifying, we get $\\frac{34}{16}+\\frac{2}{r^2}=\\frac{25}{16}+\\frac{5}{2r}+\\frac{1}{r^2}$\\[\\frac{1}{r^2}-\\frac{5}{2r}+\\frac{9}{16}=0\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{16}{r^2}-\\frac{40}{r}+9=0\\]\n\n\n\\[\\left(\\frac{4}{r}-9\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{r}-1\\right)=0\\]Obviously $r$ cannot equal $4$, therefore $r = \\boxed{\\frac 49}$.As in solution 1, in triangle $ABC$ we have $AB = 1+4 = 5$ and $BC=4-1 = 3$, thus by the Pythagorean theorem or pythagorean triples in general, we have $AC=4$.\nLet $r$ be the radius. Let $s$ be the perpendicular intersecting point $S$ and line $BC$. $AC=s$ because $s,$ both perpendicular radii, and $AC$ form a rectangle. We just have to find $AC$ in terms of $r$ and solve for $r$ now. From the Pythagorean theorem and subtracting to get lengths, we get $AC=s=4=\\sqrt{(r+1)^2 - (1-r)^2} + \\sqrt{(r+4)^2 - (4-r)^2}$, which is simply $4=\\sqrt{4r}+\\sqrt{16r} \\implies \\sqrt{r}=\\frac{2}{3} \\implies r= \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } \\frac{4}{9}}.$~Wezzerwez7254"

      "This is a Pythagorean triple (a $3-4-5$ actually) with legs $15$ and $20$. The area is then $\\frac{(15)(20)}{2}=150$. Now, consider an altitude drawn to any side. Since the area remains constant, the altitude and side to which it is drawn are inversely proportional. To get the smallest altitude, it must be drawn to the hypotenuse. Let the length be $x$ ; we have $\\frac{(x)(25)}{2}=\\frac{(15)(20)}{2}$, so $25x=300$ and $x$ is 12. Our answer is then $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 12}$.By Heron's formula, the area is $150$, hence the shortest altitude's length is $2\\cdot\\frac{150}{25}=\\boxed{12\\Rightarrow \\textbf{(B)}}$.The sides are in the ratio of $3-4-5$, and are therefore a Pythagorean Triple and a part of a right triangle.\nWe know two altitudes, the legs $15$ and $20$. All that is left is to check the altitude from the right angle vertex to the hypotenuse. There is a rule that states that the three triangles formed when the altitude is dropped (the big triangle and two smaller ones it gets split into) are similar! We take the triangle with hypotenuse $20$. The ratio of sides between that triangle and the bigger one is $4:5$. Since the side of length $15$ in the big triangle corresponds with our altitude, we take $15\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}$ to get our answer ${12}$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 12}$.The triangle forms a $3-4-5$ right triangle, so we can first draw a triangle with legs $3$ and $4$ and hypotenuse $5$. The two altitudes $3$ and $4$ are known, and the area is $6$ ; therefore $5x/2 = 6$, and $x=12/5$, which is clearly less than $3$ or $4$. Now scale the triangle back up by multiplying every dimension by $5$. The smallest altitude is then $12/5 * 5$ = ${12}$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 12}$"

We can use point-slope form to find the equation for line $GE$. First, we know that its slope is $-2$, and we know that it passes through $E=(-5,0)$, so line $GE$ has equation $-2(x+5)$. Solving for the intersection by letting $-\\frac{4}{3}x=-2(x+5)$, we get $x=-15$.

Using this information, we can write the equation $\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{4+x}{y}$. Through simplifying this equation, we get that $y=2x+8$. Let point $I$ be the point on line $FG$ so that lines $CI$ and $FG$ are perpendicular, and we get that $GI = 2x$ and $FI =8$. Doing some more angle chasing, we can find that $\\triangle GIH \\sim \\triangle GFA$, as they both share $\\angle FGH$ and they both have a right angle.With this information, we can write the equation $\\frac{x+3}{y-8} = \\frac{x+9}{y}.$\nSimplifying this equation we get the equation $-8x+6y-72 = 0$.\nPlugging in $y=2x+8$ for $6y$, we get $4x-24 = 0$, so $x=6$.\nLastly, to find the value of y, which is the value of Line $FG$, our desired value, we plug in $6$ for $x$ in the equation $y=2x+8$, we get $2(6)+8$, which, finally, we get our $y$ value of $20$, so therefore, our answer is $GF= \\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)}\\ 20}$~Darth_CadetDraw a coordinate plane with the y-axis centered on $CD$ and the x-axis centered on $AD$. From there, call the line passing through $CE$ $a$ and the line passing through $HA$ $b$. From there, you can find that the equations for these lines are $y=-2x+8$ and $y=-4/3 x+12$ respectively. We need to find the length of $GF$, so we are finding the y-value of the point $G$. Solving for this point, we get $-4/3 x+12=-2x+8$ ; $2/3x=-4$ ; $x=-6$. Now, plugging in the values, we find that $y=-2(-6)+8=20$, so our answer is $GF= \\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)}\\ 20}$.~iamcalifornia'sresidentidiot"

      "Let the squares be labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.When the polygon is folded, the \"right\" edge of square $A$ becomes adjacent to the \"bottom edge\" of square $C$, and the \"bottom\" edge of square $A$ becomes adjacent to the \"bottom\" edge of square $D$.So, any \"new\" square that is attatched to those edges will prevent the polygon from becoming a cube with one face missing.Therefore, squares $1$, $2$, and $3$ will prevent the polygon from becoming a cube with one face missing.Squares $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, and $9$ will allow the polygon to become a cube with one face missing when folded.Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(E)}\\ 6}$.Another way to think of it is that a cube missing one face has $5$ of its $6$ faces. Since the shape has $4$ faces already, we need another face. The only way to add another face is if the added square does not overlap any of the others. $1$, $2$, and $3$ overlap, while squares $4$ to $9$ do not. The answer is $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(E)}\\ 6}$If you're good at visualizing, you can imagine each box and fold up the shape into a 3D shape. This solution is only recommended if you are either in a hurry or extremely skilled at visualizing. We find out that $4,5,6,7,8$ and $9$ work. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(E)}\\ 6}$. ~Sophia866"

Connect them to $A$ and $B$ to get the picture below:[asy] unitsize(1.5cm); defaultpen(0.8); pair O=(0,0), A=(0,1), B=(0,-1); path bigc1 = Circle(A,2), bigc2 = Circle(B,2), smallc = Circle(O,1); pair[] P = intersectionpoints(bigc1, bigc2); filldraw( arc(A,P[0],P[1])--arc(B,P[1],P[0])--cycle, lightgray, black ); draw(bigc1); draw(bigc2); dot(A); dot(B); label(\"$A$\",A,N); label(\"$B$\",B,S); /* dot(O); unfill(smallc); draw(smallc); draw( O--dir(30) ); draw( A--(A+2*dir(30)) ); draw( B--(B+2*dir(210)) ); label(\"$1$\", O--dir(30), N ); label(\"$2$\", A--(A+2*dir(30)), N ); label(\"$2$\", B--(B+2*dir(210)), S ); */ label(\"$C$\",P[0],W); label(\"$D$\",P[1],E); draw( P[0]--A--P[1] ); draw( P[0]--B--P[1] ); draw( A--B ); [/asy]We can see that the triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle ABD$ are both equilateral with side $2$.Take a look at the lower circle. The angle $ABC$ is $60^\\circ$, thus sector $ABC$ is $1/6$ of the circle. The same is true for sector $ABD$ of the lower circle, and sectors $CAB$ and $BAD$ of the upper circle.If we now sum the areas of these four sectors, we will almost get the area of the new shaded region - except that each of the two equilateral triangles will be counted twice. The area of an equilateral triangle given its side, $s,$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt3}4s^2.$Therefore, the area of the new shaded region is $4\\cdot \\left( \\frac 16 \\cdot \\pi\\cdot 2^2 \\right) - 2 \\cdot \\left( 4 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt3}4 \\right) = \\frac 83 \\pi - 2\\sqrt 3$. Lastly, we must subtract the area of the circle that we added earlier, $\\pi$, and we get$\\left( \\frac 83 \\pi - 2\\sqrt 3 \\right) - \\pi = \\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)\\ } \\frac 53 \\pi - 2\\sqrt 3 }$.",
      "Notice that answer choices (C), (D), and (E) are exactly $\\pi$ more than answer choices (A), (B). This suggests that answer choices (C), (D), and (E) are meant to trick you into forgetting to subtract the circle with radius $1$ (area $\\pi$ ) From this, (A) or (B) are probably the answer choices (since you do need to subtract $\\pi$ at the end!) Since the angle measures of the sectors are $120^{\\circ},$ and we are working with the areas of some equilateral triangles, it only makes sense for the answer to have a $\\sqrt 3$ and not a $\\sqrt 2$ in them (There's no $45^{\\circ}$ angle either). So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)\\ } \\frac 53 \\pi - 2\\sqrt 3 }$.~lpieleanu (minor editing and extra details)"

      "Using the same diagram as in Solution 1, we can extend the sides of length $1$ to form a bounding square around the octagon, with the region inside the square but outside the octagon consisting of $4$ right triangles. (We could also extend the sides of length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ to give a similar bounding square, but this would make the computations slightly harder.)As in Solution 1, since all the interior angles of the octagon are $135^{\\circ}$, the right triangles are all $45^{\\circ}-45^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}$ triangles with hypotenuse $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Thus the length of their other legs is $\\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}$, so the bounding square has total side length $1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2$, and hence area $2^2 = 4$. Each of the right triangles has area $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{8}$, so we deduce that the area of the octagon is $4 - 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{7}{2}}$.edited by mobius247",

We already know that $\\overline{CD}=2$, so the formula becomes $A=h$. We can drop verticals down from $A$ and $M$ to points $E$ and $F$, respectively. We can see that $\\triangle AEC \\sim \\triangle MFC$. Now, we establish the relationship that $\\dfrac{AE}{MF}=\\dfrac{AC}{MC}$. We are given that $\\overline{AC}=2$, and $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$, so $\\overline{MC}=1$. Because $\\triangle AEB$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle and the ratio of the sides opposite the angles are $1-\\sqrt{3}-2$ $\\overline{AE}$ is $\\sqrt{3}$. Plugging those numbers in, we have $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{MF}=\\dfrac{2}{1}$. Cross-multiplying, we see that $2\\times\\overline{MF}=\\sqrt{3}\\times1\\implies \\overline{MF}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ Since $\\overline{MF}$ is the height $\\triangle CDM$, the area is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.Draw a line from $M$ to the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$. Call the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ $P$. This is an equilateral triangle, since the two segments $\\overline{PC}$ and $\\overline{MC}$ are identical, and $\\angle C$ is $60^{\\circ}$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, point $M$ to $\\overline{BC}$ is $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Also, the length of $\\overline{CD}$ is 2, since $C$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BD}$. So, our final equation is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\times2\\over2$, which just leaves us with $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.Drop a vertical down from $M$ to $BC$. Let us call the point of intersection $X$ and the midpoint of $BC$, $Y$. We can observe that $\\triangle AYC$ and $\\bigtriangleup MXC$ are similar. By the Pythagorean theorem, $AY$ is $\\sqrt3$.Since $AC:MC=2:1,$ we find $MX=\\frac{\\sqrt3}{2}.$ Because $C$ is the midpoint of $BD,$ and $BC=2,$ $CD=2.$ Using the area formula, $\\frac{CD*MX}{2}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}.$~ sdk652Think of $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle MCD$ being independent. Now to find area's we just solve for ratios between the triangles that we can plug in the value of $2$ (for a side of $\\triangle ABC$ ) for. Looking at the information, we see that $C$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BD}$, and this means that it bisects $\\overline{BD}$ which results in $BC=CD$. Now for the height, we can see that $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$ which means that $AM=CM$, and in turn means that the height of $\\triangle MCD$ is half of that of $\\triangle ABC$, and now plugging the ratios of the bases being the same while the height is half of the other triangle, we end up with the area of $\\triangle MCD$ being half of that of $\\triangle ABC$. Now all that's left is to find the area of $\\triangle ABC$, and for that, we plug in $2$ which leads us to the answer of $3$, but since we need to divide by two, our final answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}.$~ $\\LaTeX$ help by vadava_lx"

The diameter of the large spheres will just be the space diagonal of this cube, plus the two radiuses on either side. The side length of the cube is $2$, so the space diagonal will be $2\\sqrt{3}$. Then the diameter of the large sphere is $2\\sqrt{3} + 2$ and the radius is $\\sqrt{3} + 1$ or $\\boxed{\\mathrm{D}}$.~Silverdragon"

The triangle with hypotenuse $AB$ has legs $200$ and $2000$, while the triangle with hypotenuse $AD$ has legs $2$ and $20$. Aha! The two triangles are similar by SAS, with one triangle having side lengths $100$ times the other!Let $AD=x$. Then from our reasoning above, we have $AB=100x$. Finally, the area of the rectangle is $100x(x)=100x^2=100(20^2+2^2)=100(400+4)=100(404)=\\boxed{40400 \\text{ (E)}}$.We do not need to solve for y. We form a right triangle with $AB$ as the hypotenuse and two adjacent sides lengths 200 and 2000, respectively. We form another right triangle with $AD$ as the hypotenuse and 2 is one of the lengths of the adjacent sides. Those two triangles are similar because $AD$ and $AB$ are perpendicular. $\\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{200}{2}$, so the area $AB \\cdot AD = \\frac {AB^2}{100} = \\frac {2000^2 + 200^2}{100} = \\boxed{40400 \\text{ (E)}}$In order to find the area of rectangle $ABCD$, we need to find $AB$ first. Using the distance formula, we can derive:$AB = \\sqrt{(2006-6)^2 + (178-(-22))^2} = \\sqrt{(2000)^2 + (200)^2 } = 200\\sqrt{101}$Now we can look at the answer choices. Because all of them are integers, then we know that $AD$ has to also contain $\\sqrt{101}$ to ensure that $AB*AD$ is an integer. Once you know that, you can guarantee that the answer must be a multiple of 101. (If you're wondering why there can't be a fraction like $1/101$, there can't because $y$ is an integer the number under the square root in $AD$, is an integer.) Having that information narrows down the answer choices to just $(B)$ $4040$, and $(E)$ $40400$.Looking back at what we found for $AB$, which is $200\\sqrt{101}$, and what we know about $AD$, that it has to contain $\\sqrt{101}$. we know that the answer is at least $200\\sqrt{101}*\\sqrt{101}=20200$, which is already greater than answer choice $(B)$, which is $4040$.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle AFE$, then, we see\n\n\\[AE^2 = 9 + 5\\sqrt{2} + r^2.\\]But it can also be seen that $\\angle BDA = 45^\\circ$. Therefore, since $D$ lies on $\\overline{BE}$, $\\angle ADE = 135^\\circ$.

Since DE is equal to the radius $r$, $DZ=EZ=\\frac{r}{\\sqrt2}=\\frac{r\\sqrt2}{2}.$Note that triangles $\\triangle AFE$ and $\\triangle AZE$ share the same hypotenuse $(AE)$, meaning that\n\n\\[AZ^2+EZ^2=AF^2+EF^2\\]\n\nPlugging in our values we have:\n\n\\[\\left(s+\\frac{r\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{r\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\sqrt{9+5\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2+r^2\\]\n\n\n\\[s^2+sr\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{r^2}{2}+\\frac{r^2}{2}=9+5\\sqrt{2}+r^2\\]\n\n\n\\[s^2+sr\\sqrt{2}=9+5\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nBy logic $s=3$ and $sr=5 \\implies r=5/3.$Therefore, $\\frac{\\frac{5}{3}}{3}=\\frac{5}{9}=\\boxed{B}$Let $B=(0,0)$, $C=(s,0)$, $A=(0,s)$, $D=(s,s)$, and $E=\\left(s+\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}},s+\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)$. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to $\\triangle AFE$ to obtain\n\n\\[r^2+\\left(9+5\\sqrt{2}\\right)=\\left(s+\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2,\\]\n\nfrom which $9+5\\sqrt{2}=s^2+rs\\sqrt{2}$. Because $r$ and $s$ are rational, it follows that $s^2=9$ and $rs=5$, so $r/s = \\boxed{5/9}$.ORExtend $\\overline{AD}$ past $D$ to meet the circle at $G \\ne D$. Because $E$ is collinear with $B$ and $D$, $\\angle EDG = 45^\\circ.$ Also, $ED = EG,$ which implies $\\angle EGD = 45^\\circ$, so $\\triangle EDG$ is an isosceles right triangle. Thus $DG = r\\sqrt{2}$. By the Power of a Point Theorem,\n\n\\begin{align*} 9+5\\sqrt{2} &= AF^2 \\\\ &= AD\\cdot AG\\\\ & = AD\\cdot \\left(AD+DG\\right) \\\\ &= s\\left(s+r\\sqrt{2}\\right) \\\\ &= s^2+rs\\sqrt{2}.\\end{align*}\n\nAs in the first solution, we conclude that $r/s=\\boxed{5/9}$.(Last minute solution) We roughly measure the distance of $r$ and the distance of $y$. Since $r$ is clearly less than $s$, we can eliminate answer choices (D) and (E). Next, if we compare the distances, $r$ seems to be just a little more than half of $s$, thus eliminating answer choice (A). $r$ is only a little bit bigger than half of $s$, so we can reasonably assume that their ratio is less than $\\frac{3}{5}$. That leaves us with answer choice $\\boxed{C}$, or $\\frac{5}{9}$."

In order to find the shaded region, we need to find the area of the four shapes.When it comes to obtuse triangles, the altitude (height) is out of the shape and is always perpendicular to the base of the triangle. Notice how the two obtuse triangles each share an altitude with the length of 2, that means the height of the obtuse triangle is 2. We can now find the area of the two obtuse triangles and their areas are 1 and 2.There is one more triangle that is shaded, but luckily, it is a right triangle so the height is basically given to us, the area of the right triangle is 2.There is one last shape in this diagram, and notice it is shaped like a kite. In order to find the area of the kite, we need to find their diameters ( $d_{1}$ as the shorter diameter and $d_{2}$ as the longer diameter). Notice how the diagonal of the square is $\\sqrt 2$, so $d_{1}=2\\sqrt 2$ and $d_{2}=4\\sqrt 2$. Now we can find the area of the kite, which is $\\frac{d_{1}d_{2}}{2}=8$.Now we find the total area of the shaded region $1+2+2+8=13$ and the entire area of the grid is 36 which means our answer is $\\frac {13}{36}$.~ghfhgvghj10"

      "We rotate the smaller cube around the sphere such that two opposite vertices of the cube are on opposite faces of the larger cube. Thus the main diagonal of the smaller cube is the side length of the outer square.Let $S$ be the surface area of the inner square. The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of their sides. As the diagonal of a cube has length $s\\sqrt{3}$ where $s$ is a side of the cube, the ratio of a side of the inner square to a side of the outer square is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ (since the side of the outer square = the diagonal of the inner square). So we have $\\frac{S}{24} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2$. Thus $S = 8\\Rightarrow \\mathrm{\\boxed{(C)}}$.The area of each face of the outer cube is $\\frac {24}{6} = 4$, and the edge length of the outer cube is $2$. This is also the diameter of the sphere, and thus the length of a long diagonal of the inner cube.A long diagonal of a cube is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with a side of the cube and a face diagonal of the cube as legs. If a side of the cube is $x$, we see that $2 = \\sqrt {x^{2} + (\\sqrt {2}x)^{2}}\\Rightarrow x = \\frac {2}{\\sqrt {3}}$.Thus the surface area of the inner cube is $6x^{2} = 6\\left(\\frac {2}{\\sqrt {3}}\\right )^{2} = 8$.Since the surface area of the original cube is 24 square meters, each face of the cube has a surface area of $24/6 = 4$ square meters, and the side length of this cube is 2 meters. The sphere inscribed within the cube has diameter 2 meters, which is also the length of the diagonal of the cube inscribed in the sphere. Let $l$ represent the side length of the inscribed cube. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice gives\n\n\\[l^2 + l^2 + l^2 = 2^2 = 4.\\]\n\nHence each face has surface area\n\n\\[l^2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\ \\text{square meters}.\\]\n\nSo the surface area of the inscribed cube is $6\\cdot \\frac43 = \\boxed{8}$ square meters.First of all, it is pretty easy to see the length of each edge of the bigger cube is $2$ so the radius of the sphere is $1$. We know that when a cube is inscribed in a sphere, assuming the edge length of the square is $x$ the radius can be presented as $\\frac {\\sqrt3x}{2} = 1$, we can solve that $x=\\frac {2\\sqrt3}{3}$ and now we only need to apply the basic formula to find the surface and we got our final answer as $\\frac {2\\sqrt3}{3}*\\frac {2\\sqrt3}{3}*6=8$ and the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$"

      "Let the legs of the triangle have lengths $a,b$. Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$, and the area of the triangle is $\\frac 12 ab$. So we have the two equationsRe-arranging the first equation and squaring,From $(2)$ we have $2ab = 80$, soThe length of the hypotenuse is $p - a - b = 32 - \\frac{69}{4} = \\frac{59}{4}\\boxed{\\ \\mathrm{(B)}}$.From the formula $A = rs$, where $A$ is the area of a triangle, $r$ is its inradius, and $s$ is the semiperimeter, we can find that $r = \\frac{20}{32/2} = \\frac{5}{4}$. In a right triangle, $r = s - h$, where $h$ is the hypotenuse, so $h = 16 - \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{59}{4}$ $\\mathrm{(B)}$.Note: If the reader is unfamiliar with the inradius being equal to the semiperimeter minus the hypotenuse for a right triangle, it should not be too difficult to prove the relationship for themselves.~mobius247Why $r=s-h$. Draw a right triangle and inscribe a circle. Connect the center of the circle with tangency points; there are 3, one from each side of the triangle. Now, connect the center with each vertice and you will see 3 pairs of congruent triangles by HL (Hypotenuse-Leg Congruence). From these congruent triangles, mark equal lengths and you will find that $r=s-h$.~BakedPotato66From the problem, we know thatSubtracting $c$ from both sides of the first equation and squaring both sides, we getNow we substitute in $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ as well as $2ab = 80$ into the equation to getFurther simplification yields the result of $\\frac{59}{4} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{(B)}$.Let $a$ and $b$ be the legs of the triangle and $c$ the hypotenuse.Since the area is 20, we have $\\frac{1}{2}ab = 20 => ab=40$.Since the perimeter is 32, we have $a + b + c = 32$.The Pythagorean Theorem gives $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.This gives us three equations with three variables:Rewrite equation 3 as $c^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab$.\nSubstitute in equations 1 and 2 to get $c^2 = (32-c)^2 - 80$.The answer is choice $(B)$.Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the sides of the triangle with $c$ as the hypotenuse.We know that $a + b + c =32$.According to the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.We also know that $ab = 40$, since the area of the triangle is $20$.We substitute $2ab$ into $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ to get $(a+b)^2 = c^2 + 80$.Moving the $c^2$ to the left, we again rewrite to get $(a+b+c)(a+b-c) = 80$.We substitute our value of $32$ for $a+b+c$ twice into our equation and subtract to get $a + b = \\frac{69}{4}$.Finally, subtracting this from our original value of $32$, we get $\\frac{59}{4}$, or $B$.Let the legs be $a, b$. Then the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.$We know that $ab = 40$ and $a + b + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 32$.The first equation gives\n\n\\[b = \\frac{40}{a}\\]\n\nand we can plug this into the second equation, yielding:\n\n\\[a + \\frac{40}{a} + \\sqrt{ a^2 + \\frac{1600}{a^2}} = 32.\\]Letting $X = a + \\frac{40}{a}$, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[X + \\sqrt{X^2 - 80} = 32.\\]We can bring the $X$ to the right side and square which yields:\n\n\\[X^2 - 80 = (X - 32)^2 = X^2 - 64X + 1024.\\]So,\n\n\\[-80 = -64X + 1024 \\rightarrow X = \\frac{69}{4}.\\]Now, we know that $a + \\frac{40}{a} = \\frac{69}{4}.$Multiplying both sides by $4a$ gives:\n\n\\[4a^2 - 69a + 160.\\]It can be observed that the roots of this equation are $a$ and $b$. We want the hypotenuse which is $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{ (a+b)^2 - 2ab}.$We can now apply Vieta's Formula which gives:\n\n\\[c = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{69}{4} \\right)^2 - 80} = \\boxed{ \\frac{59}{4}}.\\]~conantwiz2023Let the sides be $a, b, c$ where $a$ and $b$ are the legs and $c$ is the hypotenuse.Since the perimeter is 32, we have$(1) \\phantom{a} a+b+c=32$.Since the area is 20 and the legs are $a$ and $b$, we have that$(2) \\phantom{a} \\frac{a \\cdot b}{2}=20$.By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have that$(3) \\phantom{a} a^2+b^2=c^2$.Since we want $c$, we will equations $1, 2, 3$ be in the form of $c.$Equation 1 can be turned into$(4) \\phantom{a} a+b=32-c$.Equation 2 can be simplified into$(5) \\phantom{a} ab=40.$Equation 3 is already simplified.Onto the calculating process.Squaring the 1st equation we have$(a+b+c)^2=32^2.$Expanding and grouping, we have$(a^2+b^2+c^2)+2(ab+ac+bc)=32^2.$By equation 3 and substituting we get$2(c^2+ab+ac+bc)=32^2.$By equation 5 and substituting we get$2(c^2+40+ac+bc)=32^2.$Note that we can factor $c$ out in the inner expression, and we get$2(c^2+40+c(a+b))=32^2.$By equation 4 and substituting, we have$2(c^2+40+c(32-c))=32^2.$Expanding, we have$2(c^2+40+32c-c^2)=32^2.$Simplifying, we have$2(40+32c)=32^2.$Expanding again, we get$80+64c=32^2.$Dividing both sides by $16$ gets us$4c+5=64$Calculating gets us$c=\\boxed{\\mathrm{(B) \\frac{59}{4}}}$.~mathboy282This solution is very similar to Solution 1, except instead of subtracting $a+b$ from both sides in the first part, we subtract $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ from both sides, which gets us:\\begin{align*} a+b&=32-\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\\\\ (a+b)^2&=(32-\\sqrt{a^2+b^2})^2\\\\ a^2+2ab+b^2&=32^2-2\\cdot32\\cdot\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}+a^2+b^2\\\\ 2ab&=32^2-2\\cdot32\\cdot\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}.\\\\ \\end{align*}We know that\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}ab=20\\]\n\nso\n\n\\[ab=40.\\]We can then substitute $40$ for $ab$ to get us:\\begin{align*} 80&=32^2-2\\cdot32\\cdot\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\\\\ 2\\cdot32\\cdot\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}&=32^2-80\\\\ 64\\cdot\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}&=32^2-80\\\\ \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}&=\\frac{32^2-80}{64}\\\\ \\end{align*}We know that $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ is the hypotenuse, so we only have to solve the right-hand side now.\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}&=\\frac{32^2-80}{64}\\\\ &=\\frac{32^2}{64}-\\frac{80}{64}\\\\ &=\\frac{32\\cdot32}{32\\cdot2}-\\frac{32\\cdot\\frac{5}{2}}{32\\cdot2}\\\\ &=\\frac{32}{2}-\\frac{\\frac{5}{2}}{2}\\\\ &=16-\\frac{5}{4}\\\\ &=\\frac{64}{4}-\\frac{5}{4}\\\\ &=\\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)} \\frac{59}{4}}\\\\ \\end{align*}~zlrara01"

By the transitive property:$mADB + mBDC = mDBA + mABE$$mBDC = mDBA$$mADB + mBDC = mBDC + mABE$$mADB = mABE$Next, because every triangle has a degree measure of $180$, angle $BEA$ and angle $DBA$ are similar.Hence $BE/AB = DB/AD$, and therefore $BE = AB\\cdot DB/AD = 20/3$.Also triangle $CBF$ is similar to $ABD$.

The answer is $\\mathrm{(C)}$ ( what a coincidence\u00a0;) ).The unit square is of area 1, so the five unit squares have area 5.\nTherefore the shaded space must occupy 2.5.

This triangle has a base length of $3-c$ and a height of $3$. The area of this triangle region is now (using the formula $A=bh/2$ for a triangle) $(9-3c)/2$. But, remember that we have to subtract the area of the extra unit square from this area to get the area of the shaded region.If you add 3 unit squares to the top of the unshaded portion, the figure is now a right trapezoid. Using the formula for a trapezoid, you can derive that its area is $(9+3c)/2$. After you subtract the area of the 3 extra unit squares, we have derived the area of the unshaded portion.Since these areas are both equal, we set them equal to each other and solve for $c$. $(9-3c)/2 -1 = (9+3c)/2 -3$.\n$c$ is now solved to be $\\frac{2}{3}$. $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(C)}}$.~Solution by athens2016We are looking for the area of the shaded region to be $\\frac 52$.

Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(C) \\frac 23}}$.~ SouthUse the shoelace theorem to get the area of the unshaded portion in terms of a. Divide this area by the whole area which is 5.

      "The area of any parallelogram $ABCD$ can be computed as the size of the vector product of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AD}$.In our setting where $A=(0,0)$, $B=(s,s)$, and $D=(t,kt)$ this is simply $s\\cdot kt - s\\cdot t = (k-1)st$.In other words, we need to count the triples of integers $(k,s,t)$ where $k>1$, $s,t>0$ and $(k-1)st = 1,\\!000,\\!000 = 2^6 5^6$.These can be counted as follows: We have $6$ identical red balls (representing powers of $2$ ), $6$ blue balls (representing powers of $5$ ), and three labeled urns (representing the factors $k-1$, $s$, and $t$ ). The red balls can be distributed in ${8\\choose 2} = 28$ ways, and for each of these ways, the blue balls can then also be distributed in $28$ ways. (See Distinguishability for a more detailed explanation.)Thus there are exactly $28^2 = 784$ ways how to break $1,\\!000,\\!000$ into three positive integer factors, and for each of them we get a single parallelogram. Hence the number of valid parallelograms is $784 \\longrightarrow \\boxed{C}$.Without the vector product the area of $ABCD$ can be computed for example as follows: If $B=(s,s)$ and $D=(t,kt)$, then clearly $C=(s+t,s+kt)$. Let $B'=(s,0)$, $C'=(s+t,0)$ and $D'=(t,0)$ be the orthogonal projections of $B$, $C$, and $D$ onto the $x$ axis. Let $[P]$ denote the area of the polygon $P$.

      "We know that $A$ is $(0, 0)$. Since $B$ is on the line $y=x$, let it be represented by the point $(b, b)$. Similarly, let $D$ be $(d, kd)$. Since this is a parallelogram, sides $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ are parallel. Therefore, the distance and relative position of $D$ to $A$ is equivalent to that of $C$ to $B$ (if we take the translation of $A$ to $D$ and apply it to $B$, we will get the coordinates of $C$ ). This yields $C (b+d, b+kd)$. Using the Shoelace Theorem we get$1,000,000 = \\frac{1}{2}|\\left(b(b+kd) + (b+d)(kd)\\right) - \\left(b(b+d) + (b+kd)d\\right)|$$\\Rightarrow 2,000,000 = |2kbd - 2bd|$$\\Rightarrow 1,000,000 = |kbd - bd|$Since $k > 1, kbd > bd$. The equation becomes$1,000,000 = (k-1)bd$$\\Rightarrow \\frac{1,000,000}{k-1} = bd$Since $k$ must be a positive integer greater than $1$, we know $k-1$ will be a positive integer. We also know that $bd$ is an integer, so $k-1$ must be a factor of $1,000,000$. Therefore $bd$ will also be a factor of $1,000,000$.Notice that $1,000,000 = 10^6 = 2^6*5^6$.Let $b$ be $2^x5^y$ such that $x, y$ are integers on the interval $[0, 6]$.Let $d$ be $2^w5^z$ such that $w, z$ are integers, $x+w \\le 6$, and $y+z \\le 6$.For a pair $(x, y)$, there are $7-x$ possibilities for $w$ and $7-y$ possibilites for $z$ ( $d$ doesn't have to be the co-factor of $1,000,000$, it just can't be big enough such that $bd > 1,000,000$ ), for a total of $(7-x)(7-y)$ possibilities. So we want$\\sum_{k=0, i=0}^6 (7-k)(7-i)$$\\left(\\text{the sum of the number of possible pairs}(w, z) \\text{ for all pairs}(k, i)\\text{ for } k[0, 6]\\text{ and } i[0, 6]\\right)$Notice that if we \"fix\" the value of $k$, at, say $6$, then run through all of the values of $i$, change the value of $k$ to $5$, and run through all of the values of $i$ again, and so on until we exhaust all $49$ combinations of $(k, i)$ we get something like this:$1*1 + 1*2 +... + 1*6 + 1*7 + 2*1 + 2*2 +... + 2*6 + 2*7 +..... + 7*1 + 7*2 +... + 7*6 + 7*7$which can be rewritten$1(1+2+...+7)+2(1+2+...+7)+.....+7(1+2+...+7)$$\\Rightarrow (1+2+...+7)(1+2+...+7)$$\\Rightarrow 28^2$$\\Rightarrow 784$So there are $784$ possible sets of coordinates $B,$ $C$, and $D \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{C}}$.Note: this solution could be greatly simplified by using the Shoelace Formula on the triangle $ABD$, which we know has half the area of the parallelogram. This eliminates the need to find the coordinates of point $C$.(Notational note: I'm not sure if the notation for double index summation is correct or even applicable in the context of this problem. If someone could fix the notation so that it is correct, or replace it without changing the general content of this solution, that would be great.

Hence the red curve intersects the blue one if and only if it contains a point whose distance from the origin is at most $k$.At this point we can guess that on the red curve the point where $x=y$ is always closest to the origin, and skip the rest of this solution.For an exact solution, fix $k$ and consider any point $(x,y)$ on the red curve. Its distance from the origin is $\\sqrt{ x^2 + (k/x)^2 }$. To minimize this distance, it is enough to minimize $x^2 + (k/x)^2$. By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality we get that this value is at least $2k$, and that equality holds whenever $x^2 = (k/x)^2$, i.e., $x=\\pm\\sqrt k$.Now recall that the red curve intersects the blue one if and only if its closest point is at most $k$ from the origin. We just computed that the distance between the origin and the closest point on the red curve is $\\sqrt{2k}$.

Similarly, if we subtract the two equations, we obtain $(x-y)^2=k^2-2k$, for which the only value of $k$ that does not satisfy the equation is $1$, for the same reason above.Thus, the only values are $k = 1, -1$, giving us a total of $\\boxed{2\\ \\textbf{(C)}}$ values.~ ccx09 (Roy Short)",

First, connect a directly opposite diagonal such as $CF$. Because the hexagon is equiangular, edges $AF$ and $BC$ protrude from points $A$ and $B$ at the same angle but in opposite directions and equal length. This places points $C$ and $F$ at the same \"height\" relative to segment $AB$, so segment $CF$ is parallel to $AB$ and also $DE$ (opposite sides are parallel since you rotated through three $120^\\circ$ angles between each other).Next, we'll calculate the area of isosceles trapezoids $ABCF$ and $CDEF$. Drop a perpendicular down from $B$ to $CF$, and call the intersection to $CF$, $P$. Because adjacent angles between parallel sides in a trapezoid sum to $180^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABC = 120^\\circ$, $\\angle BCP = 60^\\circ$ meaning $\\triangle{BPC}$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle. Now we get $BP = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}r$ and $CP = \\frac{r}{2}$. $CF$ is equal to $AB + 2CP = r+1$. Hence, the area of trapezoid $ABCF$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}r \\cdot (r+1+1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} r(r+2)$. Similarly, on trapezoid $CDEF$ we find $\\triangle EQF$ is 30-60-90, and $EQ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, FQ = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then, area of $CDEF$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (2r + 1)$. Thus, the area of the hexagon is the sum of the two areas, $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (r^2 + 4r + 1)$.Next, notice that $\\triangle ACE$ is equilateral. And by Pythagorean theorem in $\\triangle CQE$, side $CE = \\sqrt{r^2 + r + 1}$. Applying area of equilateral triangle formula, area $\\triangle ACE = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (r^2 + r + 1)$. Using this area and the area given from 70% of the area of the hexagon, we get the equation $\\frac{7}{10} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (r^2 + 4r + 1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (r^2 + r + 1)$. Simplifying, we get the quadratic $r^2-6r+1=0$, which by Vieta's yields the answer $6, \\boxed{\\textbf{E}}$.~henryWe know $\\triangle{ABC}$, $\\triangle{CDE}$, and $\\triangle{EFA}$ are congruent by SAS, so the side opposite the 120 degree angle is also the same (since the triangles are congruent).

All additional triangles will differ by one as the solutions above differ by one so this process can be repeated indefinitely until the side lengths no longer form a triangle.Subbing in gives $T_3$ with sides $502, 503, 504$.$T_4$ has sides $\\frac{501}{2}, \\frac{503}{2}, \\frac{505}{2}$.$T_5$ has sides $\\frac{499}{4}, \\frac{503}{4}, \\frac{507}{4}$.$T_6$ has sides $\\frac{495}{8}, \\frac{503}{8}, \\frac{511}{8}$.$T_7$ has sides $\\frac{487}{16}, \\frac{503}{16}, \\frac{519}{16}$.$T_8$ has sides $\\frac{471}{32}, \\frac{503}{32}, \\frac{535}{32}$.$T_9$ has sides $\\frac{439}{64}, \\frac{503}{64}, \\frac{567}{64}$.$T_{10}$ has sides $\\frac{375}{128}, \\frac{503}{128}, \\frac{631}{128}$.$T_{11}$ would have sides $\\frac{247}{256}, \\frac{503}{256}, \\frac{759}{256}$ but these lengths do not make a\ntriangle as\n\n\\[\\frac{247}{256} + \\frac{503}{256} < \\frac{759}{256}\\]Likewise, you could create an equation instead of listing all the triangles to $T_{11}$.\nThe sides of a triangle $T_{k}$ would be\n\n\\[\\frac{503}{2^{k-3}} - 1, \\frac{503}{2^{k-3}}, \\frac{503}{2^{k-3}} + 1\\]\n\nWe then have\n\n\\[503 - 2^{k-3} + 503 > 503 + 2^{k-3}\\]\n\n\n\\[1006 - 2^{k-3} > 503 + 2^{k-3}\\]\n\n\n\\[503 > 2^{k-2}\\]\n\n\n\\[9 > k-2\\]\n\n\n\\[k < 11\\]\n\nHence, the first triangle which does not exist in this sequence is $T_{11}$.Hence the perimeter is\n\n\\[\\frac{375}{128} + \\frac{503}{128} + \\frac{631}{128} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\frac{1509}{128}}\\]\n\n.",
      "Proceeding similarly to the first solution, we have that sides of each triangle are of the form $a, a+1, a+2$ for some number $a$. Also, note that the perimeter of each triangle is half of the previous one. In order for the triangle to not exist, it must not satisfy the triangle inequality, meaning that $a + a + 1 < a+2 \\Rightarrow a<1$. Then, the perimeter would be $a + a + 1 + a + 2 = 3a + 3 < 6$. So, to have a proper triangle, we have $\\frac{3018}{2^{k}} > 6 \\Rightarrow 2^k < 503 \\Rightarrow 2^{k} < 512$. The first triangle to not work would have perimeter $\\frac{3018}{256} = \\frac{1509}{128}$, thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\frac{1509}{128}}$.",
      "This problem is a PoP(Power of Point) Bash exercise. What I did to solve this problem was look at recursive perimeters. The first ever perimeter is $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$. Next, by PoP, inscribing the circle gives us three new lengths, namely $AD, BE, CF$. Denote $AD$ as $x_1$ and homogeneously the others. Then, $x_1 + x_2 = 2011, x_2 + x_3 = 2012$, and $x_1 + x_3 = 2013$. If we add all these equations up and divide by $2$, we get $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = \\frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2}$. Writing this with $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$, we get that our new perimeter, $P_2$, is indeed equal to $\\frac{P_1}{2}$. Similarly, by the same concept, we get that $P_3 = \\frac{P_1}{4}$ and the pattern keeps going. In general, I found that for each new perimeter $P_n$, $P_n = \\frac{P_1}{2^{n-1}}$. Now, substituting in the numerical value of $P_1$, we get that $P_n = \\frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2^{n-1}}$. If you keep dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, I got that: $P_n = \\frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$. This representation of a new perimeter in terms of $n$ looks very similar to the option choices, so we're on the right path. Now, all we need to do is find out the last value of $n$ when the sequence stops working. By the Triangular Inequality, we may be able to finish this off. Now, I won't go into depths here, but listing out terms and using the Triangular Inequality gives us:\nFirst Sequence:\n$x_1 < 2012$$x_2 < 2013$$x_3 < 2011$.\nThe ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(1005, 1006, 1007)$ if you solve the PoP system of equations we got earlier. If you keep listing out terms, we can come up with the general form, and that is:\n$x_1 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}$$x_2 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1$$x_3 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1$.\nThe ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(\\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}, \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1, \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1)$. Now, if we plug in these values of $x_1, x_2$, and $x_3$ into the inequalities, we see that the first two are always satisfied, but the last one is only satisfied when:\n$2^{n-2} < 503$ (You will get this if you simplify the last inequality). The last $n$ for this to be satisfied is when $n = 10$. If we go up to our general representation of $P_n$, we see that $P_n = \\frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$. Plugging in $10$ because this is the last $n$ (and also the last triangle), we our final answer of $\\frac{1509}{2^{7}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1509}{128}}$ or $\\boxed{D}$.~ilikemath247365"

Thus, figure $EFGH$ is a parallelogram.Computation of vectors $EF$ and $HG$ is sufficient evidence that the figure is a parallelogram, since the vectors are not only point in the same direction, but are of the same magnitude, but the other vector $FG$ is needed to find the angle between the sides.Taking the dot product of vector $EF$ and vector $FG$ gives $0 \\cdot -0.5 + 0 \\cdot 1 + -1.5 \\cdot 0 = 0$, which means the two vectors are perpendicular.

Finally, note that the line which goes though the midpoint of $P_1$ and $P_2$ with slope $3$ and the line which goes through the midpoint of $P_3$ and $P_4$ with slope $-\\frac{1}{3}$ must intersect at at the center of the square. The equation of the line going through $(4,0)$ is given by $y = 3(x-4)$ and the equation of the line going through $(10,0)$ is $y = -\\frac{1}{3}(x-10)$. Equating the two, we find that they intersect at $(4.6, 1.8)$. Adding the $x$ and $y$ -coordinates, we get $6.4 = 32/5$. Thus, answer choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$ is correct.",
      "Note that the center of the square lies along a line that has an $x-$ intercept of $\\frac{3+5}{2}=4$, and also along another line with $x-$ intercept $\\frac{7+13}{2}=10$. Since these 2 lines are parallel to the sides of the square, they are perpendicular (since the sides of a square are). Let $m$ be the slope of the first line. Then $-\\frac{1}{m}$ is the slope of the second line. We may use the point-slope form for the equation of a line to write $l_1:y=m(x-4)$ and $l_2:y=-\\frac{1}{m}(x-10)$. We easily calculate the intersection of these lines using substitution or elimination to obtain $\\left(\\frac{4m^2+10}{m^2+1},\\frac{6m}{m^2+1}\\right)$ as the center or the square. Let $\\theta$ denote the (acute) angle formed by $l_1$ and the $x-$ axis. Note that $\\tan\\theta=m$. Let $s$ denote the side length of the square. Then $\\sin\\theta=s/2$. On the other hand the acute angle formed by $l_2$ and the $x-$ axis is $90-\\theta$ so that $\\cos\\theta=\\sin(90-\\theta)=s/6$. Then $m=\\tan\\theta=3$. Substituting into $\\left(\\frac{4m^2+10}{m^2+1},\\frac{6m}{m^2+1}\\right)$ we obtain $\\left(\\frac{23}{5},\\frac{9}{5}\\right)$ so that the sum of the coordinates is $\\frac{32}{5}=6.4$.

      "Using the diagram shown in Solution 1, we can set angle $BCQ$ as $\\theta$. We know that $AB=2$ and $BC=2$. Now using $AA$similarity, we know that $\\triangle BCQ\\sim\\triangle ACP$ in a $1:2$ ratio. Now we can see that $CQ=-2$ $\\cos\\theta$, therefore,meaning that $PQ=-2$ $\\cos\\theta$. $PQRS$ is a square, so $QR=-2$ $\\cos\\theta$. We also know that $QCHR$ is also a square since itsangles are $90^\\circ$ and all of its sides are equal. Because squares $PQRS$ and $QCHR$ have equal side lengths, they arecongruent leading to the conclusion that side $CH=-2$ $\\cos\\theta$. Since $PQRS$ is a square, lines $PQ$ and $SR$ are parallelmeaning that angle $CDH$ and angle $BCQ$ are congruent. We can easily calculate that the length of $CD=6$ and furthermore that$CH=6$ $\\sin\\theta$. Setting $6\\sin\\theta=-2\\cos\\theta$, we get that $\\tan\\theta=-1/3$. This means $-1/3$ is the slope of line $PQ$and the lines parallel to it. This is good news because we are dealing with easy numbers. We can solve for the coordinates ofpoints $E$ and $F$ because they are the midpoints. This will make solving for the center of square $PQRS$ easier. $E=(4,0)$ and$F=(10,0)$. We know the slopes of lines $MF$ and $ME$, which are $-1/3$ and $3$ respectively. Now we can get the two equations.\\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=-1/3x+10/3\\\\y=3x-12\\end{array}\\right.\\]By solving:we find that $x=4.6$. Then plugging $x$ back into one of the first equations, we can find $y$ and the final coordinate turns out to be $(4.6,1.8)$.

This means that these eight points would be, not double-counted -which the calculation by Lcz accounts for- but triple-counted. Thus, taking away one for each of these points is more than enough to see the value of the answer has to be less than or equal to $59$. Choice A is the only answer that works.",
      "Like solution one, we may draw. Except note that the octagon has eight regions, and each region has an equal number of points, so drawing only one of the eight regions and the intersection points suffices. One of the eight regions contains $8$ points (not including the octagon center). However each adjacent region share one side in common and that side contains $2$ intersection points, so in actuality there are $8 - 2 = 6$ points per region. We multiply this by $8$ to get $6\\cdot 8 = 48$ and add the one center point to get $48 + 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }49}$.~skyscraper",

There are 2 cases for the above diagram:Case 1: Red DotsThe red dots are the intersection of 3 or more lines. It consists of 8 dots that make up an octagon and 1 dot in the center. Hence, there are $9$ red dots.Case 2: Blue DotsThe blue dots are the intersection of 2 lines. Each vertex of the octagon has 2 purple lines, 2 green lines, and 1 orange line coming out of it. There are 5 dots of intersection on a purple line, 6 dots on a green line, and 5 dots on an orange line. There are $2 \\cdot 5+2 \\cdot 6+5=27$ dots that come out of 1 vertex, which includes 7 red dots already counted. So there are $27-7 = 20$ blue dots coming out of 1 vertex. There are 8 vertices, but each blue dot is the intersection of 2 lines, corresponding to $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ vertices. So there are $\\frac{20 \\cdot 8}{4} = 40$ blue dots.The number of intersection dots are the sum of the number of red and blue dots.

      "We first note that diagonal $\\overline{AC}$ is of length $\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{2}$. It must be that $\\overline{AP}$ divides the diagonal into two segments in the ratio $\\sqrt{3}$ to $1$. It is not difficult to visualize that when the square is rotated, the initial and final squares overlap in a rectangular region of dimensions $2\\sqrt{3}$ by $\\sqrt{3} + 1$. The area of the overall region (of the initial and final squares) is therefore twice the area of the original square minus the overlap, or $2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)^2 - 2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) = 2 (4 + 2 \\sqrt{3}) - 2 \\sqrt{3} - 2 = 6 + 2 \\sqrt{3}$.The area also includes $4$ circular segments. Two are quarter-circles centered at $P$ of radii $\\sqrt{2}$ (the segment bounded by $\\overline{PA}$ and $\\overline{PA'}$ ) and $\\sqrt{6}$ (that bounded by $\\overline{PC}$ and $\\overline{PC'}$ ). Assuming $A$ is the bottom-left vertex and $B$ is the bottom-right one, it is clear that the third segment is formed as $B$ swings out to the right of the original square [recall that the square is rotated counterclockwise], while the fourth is formed when $D$ overshoots the final square's left edge. To find these areas, consider the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$. Call the point of intersection $E$. From the previous paragraph, it is clear that $PE = \\sqrt{3}$ and $BE = 1$. This means $PB = 2$, and $B$ swings back inside edge $\\overline{BC}$ at a point $1$ unit above $E$ (since it left the edge $1$ unit below). The triangle of the circular sector is therefore an equilateral triangle of side length $2$, and so the angle of the segment is $60^{\\circ}$. Imagining the process in reverse, it is clear that the situation is the same with point $D$.The area of the segments can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle from that of the sector; it follows that the two quarter-segments have areas $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1$ and $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{6} \\sqrt{6} = \\frac{3 \\pi}{2} - 3$. The other two segments both have area $\\frac{1}{6} \\pi (2)^2 - \\frac{(2)^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{3} - \\sqrt{3}$.The total area is therefore\n\n\\[(6 + 2 \\sqrt{3}) + (\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1) + (\\frac{3 \\pi}{2} - 3) + 2 (\\frac{2 \\pi}{3} - \\sqrt{3})\\]\n\n\n\\[= 2 + 2 \\sqrt{3} + 2 \\pi + \\frac{4 \\pi}{3} - 2 \\sqrt{3}\\]\n\n\n\\[= \\frac{10 \\pi}{3} + 2\\]\n\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{3} (10 \\pi + 6)\\]Since $a = 10$, $b = 6$, and $c = 3$, the answer is $a + b + c = 10 + 6 + 3 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} \\ 19}$."

      "Since the angles of Quadrilateral $ABCD$ form an arithmetic sequence, we can assign each angle with the value $a$, $a+d$, $a+2d$, and $a+3d$. Also, since these angles form an arithmetic progression, we can reason out that $(a)+(a+3d)=(a+d)+(a+2d)=180$.For the sake of simplicity, lets rename the angles of each similar triangle. Let $\\angle ADB = \\angle CBD = \\alpha$, $\\angle DBA = \\angle DCB = \\beta$, $\\angle CDB = \\angle BAD = \\gamma$.Now the four angles of $ABCD$ are $\\beta$, $\\alpha + \\beta$, $\\gamma$, and $\\alpha + \\gamma$.As for the similar triangles, we can name their angles $y$, $y+b$, and $y+2b$. Therefore $y+y+b+y+2b=180$ and $y+b=60$. Because these 3 angles are each equal to one of $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$, we know that one of these three angles is equal to 60 degrees.Now we we use trial and error. Let $\\alpha = 60^{\\circ}$. Then the angles of ABCD are $\\beta$, $60^{\\circ} + \\beta$, $\\gamma$, and $60^{\\circ} + \\gamma$. Since these four angles add up to 360, then $\\beta + \\gamma= 120$. If we list them in increasing value, we get $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $60^{\\circ} + \\beta$, $60^{\\circ} + \\gamma$. Note that this is the only sequence that works because the common difference is less than 45. So, this would give us the four angles 45, 75, 105, and 135. In this case, $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ also form an arithmetic sequence with 45, 60, and 75, and the largest two angles of the quadrilateral add up to 240 which is an answer choice.If we apply the same reasoning to $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, we would get the sum of the highest two angles as 220, which works but is lower than 240.

      "Let us dilate triangle $ABC$ so that the sides of equilateral triangle $BXN$ are all equal to $2.$ The purpose of this is to ease the calculations we make in the problem. Given this, we aim to find the length of segment $AM$ so that we can un-dilate triangle $ABC$ by dividing each of its sides by $AM$. Doing so will make it so that $AM = 1$, as desired, and doing so will allow us to get the length of $BN$, whose square is our final answer.Let $O$ the foot of the altitude from $B$ to $NX.$ On the coordinate plane, position $O$ at $(0, 0)$, and make $NX$ lie on the x-axis. Since points $N$, $X$, and $C$, are collinear, $C$ must also lie on the x-axis. Additionally, since $NX = 2$, $OB = \\sqrt{3}$, meaning that we can position point $B$ at $(0, \\sqrt{3})$. Now, notice that line $\\overline{AB}$ has the equation $y = \\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}$ and that line $\\overline{BM}$ has the equation $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}$ because angles $BNX$ and $BXN$ are both $60^{\\circ}$. We can then position $A$ at point $(n, \\sqrt{3}(n + 1))$ and $C$ at point $(p, 0)$. Quickly note that, because $CN$ is an angle bisector, $AC$ must pass through the point $(0, -\\sqrt{3})$.We proceed to construct a system of equations. First observe that the midpoint $M$ of $AC$ must lie on $BM$, with the equation $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}$. The coordinates of $M$ are $\\left(\\frac{p + n}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1)\\right)$, and we can plug in these coordinates into the equation of line $BM$, yielding that\n\n\\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1) = -\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{p + n}{2}) + \\sqrt{3} \\implies n + 1 = -p - n + 2 \\implies p = -2n + 1.\\]\n\nFor our second equation, notice that line $AC$ has equation $y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{p}x - \\sqrt{3}$. Midpoint $M$ must also lie on this line, and we can substitute coordinates again to get\n\n\\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{p}(\\frac{p + n}{2}) - \\sqrt{3} \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{p + n}{p} - 2 \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{n}{p} - 1\\]\n\n\n\\[\\implies p = \\frac{n}{n + 2}.\\]Setting both equations equal to each other and multiplying both sides by $(n + 2)$, we have that $-2n^2 - 4n + n + 2 = n \\implies -2n^2 - 4n + 2 = 0$, which in turn simplifies into $0 = n^2 + 2n - 1$ when dividing the entire equation by $-2.$ Using the quadratic formula, we have that\n\n\\[n = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = -1 - \\sqrt{2}.\\]\n\nHere, we discard the positive root since $A$ must lie to the left of the y-axis. Then, the coordinates of $C$ are $(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, and the coordinates of $A$ are $(-1 - \\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{6}).$ Seeing that segment $AM$ has half the length of side $AC$, we have that the length of $AM$ is\n\n\\[\\frac{\\sqrt{(3 + 2\\sqrt{2} - (-1 - \\sqrt{2}))^2 + (\\sqrt{6})^2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{16 + 24\\sqrt{2} + 18 + 6}}{2} = \\sqrt{10 + 6\\sqrt{2}}.\\]Now, we divide each side length of $\\triangle ABC$ by $AM$, and from this, $BN^2$ will equal $\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10 + 6\\sqrt{2}}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{5+3\\sqrt{2}} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}.}$",

Now drop the altitude from $E$ of $\\triangle DEF$, forming two $30-60-90$ triangles.Because the length of $AD$ is $x$, from the properties of a $30-60-90$ triangle the length of $AE$ is $\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ and the length of $DE$ is thus $\\frac{2x\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

      "The circumference of the clock is twice that of the disk. So, a quarter way around the clock (3:00), the point halfway around the disk will be tangent. The arrow will point to the left. We can see the disk made a 75% rotation from 12 to 3, and 3 is 75% of 4, so it would make 100% rotation from 12 to 4. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$. Similarly, the arrow would be pointing downward at 6:00. It would already have completed three 180 degree turns. Therefore, two 180 degree turns would be completed at 4:00.",
      "The rotation factor of the arrow is the sum of the rates of the regular rotation of the arrow (360\u00b0 every 360\u00b0 rotation = 1) and the rotation of the disk around the clock with twice the circumference (360\u00b0 every 180\u00b0 = 2). Thus, the rotation factor of the arrow is 3, and so our answer corresponds to 360\u00b0/3 = 120\u00b0, which is 4 o' clock. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$",
      "The arrow travels a path of radius 30 (20 from the interior clock and 10 from the radius of the disk itself). We note that 1 complete rotation of 360 degrees is needed for the arrow to appear up again, so, therefore, the disk must travel its circumference before the arrow goes up. Its circumference is $20\\pi$, so that is $20\\pi$ traveled on a $60\\pi$ arrow path.

      "We unfold the big clock and draw the small clock. We know that the small clocks arrow will be facing up again at 6 o clock on the unfolded big clock.

We now draw corresponding arrows at each hour and fold it back again.",
      "We can approach this problem with angle measures. As the circumference of the disk is $10\\pi,$ and the clock $20 \\pi,$ we have that 30 degrees, or the angular measure between hours, of the disk is only 15 degrees of the clock. This yields that every two hour ticks that the clock rotates, on the third one, the ticks will meet. However, the disk must rotate 360 degrees in order to come back to its original position, so the angular measure that the disk has covered relative to the clock is simply $12 \\cdot 15 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3},$ or $120^\\circ$ from the 12 starting point, so $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$.~ab2024",
      "If the big clock were a flat plane, then the smaller clock could travel $\\dfrac{40\\pi}{20\\pi}=2$ full revolutions.But we also need to account for rotation. If we mark a red dot on the bottom of the small clock/bottom of the arrow, and then drag it around the clock, the direction of the arrow would still change. After traveling around the big clock, the small clock would travel $1$ full rotation.Considering these two movements, the small clock travels 3 full rotations around the big clock so the arrow is next pointing upwards at $\\dfrac{12 \\text{ o'clock}}{3}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$.~BakedPotato66",
      "The center of rotation is in the center of the smaller circle, but extends to the center of the larger circle. That means the circumference of the circle in relation to the arrow is $60 \\pi$. The other circle is $20 \\pi$ and so that is $\\frac{1}{3}$. So $\\frac{12}{3} = 4$ which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$.",
      "Let the center of the disk be Planet X with orbit eccentricity $0$ and the center of the clock be the Sun. Note that the question would then be asking for the solar day of Planet X, rather than the sidereal day. Because planet X is rotating around its axis in the same direction as it is revolving around the Sun, the solar day can be calculated as $d_{solar}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{y}+\\frac{1}{d_{siderial}}}$, where $y$ is the length of the year of Planet X and $d_{siderial}$ is one sidereal day.

Remember that $\\triangle BOX$ and $\\triangle XOA$ are not full triangles and are only half for these purposes. We count it up and we get a total of $\\frac{3.5}{8}$ of the shape shaded. We then simplify it to get our answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~\\frac{7}{16}}$.",

We know that X is the midpoint of BA and that each space between two points is 8 because 64/8=8. This means that BX=4 because 8/2=4. Then, we add that to 3*8 because there are 3 spaces between points that are each 8. After that, you turn it into a fraction, 28/64, and simplify to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~\\frac{7}{16}}$.",

We can also notice that point $X$ to point $E$ *ALMOST* makes the octagon half shaded. Since we know an octagon has 8 sides, $X$ is one-half of $\\overline{AB}$ which means instead of counting in eights, we need to count in sixteenths. Now back to the problem. Let's say that the midpoint of $\\overline{EF}$ is $Y$, then $\\overline{XY}$ cuts the octagon perfectly in half, but since there is no $Y$, we are now $\\frac1{16}$ away from one-half. We know that $\\frac1{2}=\\frac8{16}$, so we can just do $\\frac8{16}-\\frac1{16}$ which gets us, for the final answer, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~\\frac{7}{16}}$.~ AM24"

Now, since we know that angle IJB is right, and we know that line IJ now acts as a transversal to lines IJ and AL. That means angle IJB(90 degrees) must be equal to angle JBL by the alternate-exterior angle rule. Since we know that triangle JKB is equilateral, angle JBK will be 60 degrees, hence angle KBL will be 90 - 60 = 30 degrees. Now, we move on to figure ABCDEF. Through the solution above, we know that angle ABC is 120 degrees, so we can use the same line AL which will result in the formation of a linear pair of angles: angles ABC and CBL. Since the angles in a linear pair always add up to 180, and angle ABC is 120, angle CBL = 180 - 120 = 60 degrees. Notice that angle CBL and angle KBL together make up angle KBC. Hence, by the value of 30 degrees derived for angle KBL, angle KBC = angle KBL + angle CBL = 30 degrees + 60 degrees = 90 degrees."

Therefore, we get $\\frac{48}{4} =\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 12}$.We can find the area of the entire rectangle, DCBA to be $8 \\cdot 6=48$ and find DCM area to be $\\frac{6 \\cdot 4}{2} = 12$ and BCA to be $\\frac{6 \\cdot 8}{2}=24$, $48-12-24=$ $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 12}$.A triangle is half of a rectangle. So since M is the midpoint of DA, we can see that triangle DAC is half of the whole rectangle. And it is also true that triangle MAC is half of triangle DAC, so triangle MAC would just be 1/4 of the whole rectangle. Since the rectangle's area is 48, 1/4 of 48 would be 12. Which gives us the answer $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 12}$.We can subtract the total areas of triangles DCM and ABC from the rectangle ABCD. For triangle DCM, the base is 4 and the height is 6, so we multiply 4 and 6, then divide by 2 to get 12. For triangle ABC, the base is 4 and the height is 8, so we multiply 4 and 8, then divide by 2 to get 24. We add 24 and 12 to get 36. Then, we calculate the area of rectangle ABCD, which is 48. We subtract 36 from 48, resulting in $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 12}$.-BananaBall00"

      "In order to solve this problem, we must first visualize what the region looks like. We know that, in a three dimensional space, the region consisting of all points within $3$ units of a point would be a sphere with radius $3$. However, we need to find the region containing all points within $3$ units of a segment. It can be seen that our region is a cylinder with two hemispheres/endcaps on either end. We know the volume of our region, so we set up the following equation (the volume of our cylinder + the volume of our two hemispheres will equal $216 \\pi$ ):$\\frac{4 \\pi }{3} \\cdot 3^3+9 \\pi x=216 \\pi$, where $x$ is equal to the length of our line segment.Solving, we find that $x = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 20}$.",

      "Because $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are lattice points, there are only a few coordinates that actually satisfy the equation. The coordinates are $(\\pm 3,\\pm 4), (\\pm 4, \\pm 3), (0,\\pm 5),$ and $(\\pm 5,0).$ We want to maximize $PQ$ and minimize $RS.$ They also have to be non perfect squares, because they are both irrational. The greatest value of $PQ$ happens when $P$ and $Q$ are almost directly across from each other and are in different quadrants. For example, the endpoints of the segment could be $(-4,3)$ and $(3,-4)$ because the two points are almost across from each other. Another possible pair could be $(-4,3)$ and $(5,0)$. To find out which segment is longer, we have to compare the distances from their endpoints to a diameter (which must be the longest possible segment). The closest diameter would be from $(-4,3)$ to $(4,-3)$. The distance between $(3,-4)$ and $(-4,3)$ is greater than the distance between $(5,0)$ and $(4,-3)$. Therefore, the segment from $(3,-4)$ to $(-4,3)$ is the longest attainable (the other possible coordinates for $P$ and $Q$ are $(4,3)$ and $(-3, -4)$, $(3, 4)$ and $(-4, -3)$, $(-3, 4)$ and $(4, -3)$. The least value of $RS$ is when the two endpoints are in the same quadrant and are very close to each other. This can occur when, for example, $R$ is $(3,4)$ and $S$ is $(4,3).$ They are in the same quadrant and no other point on the circle with integer coordinates is closer to the point $(3,4)$ than $(4,3)$ and vice versa.

Thus, the smallest possible value of $RS$ is $\\sqrt{1^{2}+1^{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$. Assuming that $\\frac{PQ}{RS} = 7$, we plug in $RS = \\sqrt{2}$ and solve for $PQ$ : $PQ=7\\sqrt{2}$. Remember, we don't know if this is possible yet, we are only trying to figure out if it is. But for what values of $x$ and $y$ does $\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=7\\sqrt2$? We see that this can easily be made into a $45-45-90$ triangle. But, instead of substituting $y=x$ into the equation and then using a whole lot of algebra, we can save time and use the little trick, that if in a $45-45-90$ triangle, the two $45$ degree sides have side length $s$, then the hypotenuse is $s\\sqrt2$.

      "By inspection, when $R$ is at $(3, 4)$ and $S$ is at $(4, 3),$ it makes $RS$ as small as possible with a distance of $\\sqrt{2}$. The greatest possible length of $PQ$ arises when $P$ is at $(-3, 4)$ and $Q$ is at $(4, -3).$ Using the distance formula, we find that $PQ$ has a length of $7\\sqrt{2}.$ The requested fraction is then $\\dfrac{PQ}{RS} = \\dfrac{7\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\boxed{\\mathrm{\\textbf{(D)}}\\ 7}$."

      "We start by setting the formula for the volume of a rectangular pyramid: $\\frac{1}{3}Bh$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that $BE = \\sqrt{BF^2 + EF^2} = \\sqrt{13}$. Therefore, the area of the base is $1 \\times \\sqrt{13} = \\sqrt{13}$. Next, we would like to know the height of the pyramid. We can observe that the altitude from point $F$ in $\\triangle EFB$ is parallel to the height of the pyramid and therefore congruent because those two altitudes are on the same plane of base $EBCH$. From this, we only need to find the altitude from point $F$ in $\\triangle EFB$ and plug it into our formula for the volume of a rectangular pyramid. This is easy because we already know the area of $\\triangle EFB$ and the base from point $F$, so all we need to do is divide: $\\frac{2 \\times 3}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{13}}{13}$.

      "Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can easily find that $EB = \\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{13}$. Quickly computing, we find the area of the base, $BCHE = \\sqrt{13} \\cdot 1 = \\sqrt{13}$. Now we can make the following adjustments to our 3d shape as shown in the diagram. All we need now is to solve for the height, or $XM$.

We can set up the following equations:\n\n\\begin{align*} b(a+b) &= (MH_1)^2 \\\\ a(a+b) &= (MH_2)^2 \\\\ b\\sqrt{13} &= 3^2 \\\\ a\\sqrt{13} &= 2^2 \\\\ b &= \\dfrac{9}{\\sqrt{13}} \\\\ a &= \\dfrac{4}{\\sqrt{13}} \\\\ (MX)^2 &= ab \\\\ (MX)^2 &= \\dfrac{9 \\cdot 4}{13} \\\\ MX &= \\dfrac {3 \\cdot 2}{\\sqrt{13}} \\\\ \\end{align*}\n\nThus $\\triangle V_{BCHEM} = \\dfrac{\\text{(height)}\\cdot \\text{(base)}}{3} = \\dfrac{MX \\cdot BCHE}{3} = \\dfrac {\\sqrt{13} \\cdot \\dfrac{3 \\cdot 2}{\\sqrt{13}}}{3}$ $= \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 2}$~ Wiselion\u00a0:)",
      "First of all, we can quickly calculate the base area $EBCH$ to be $\\sqrt{13}$, since $BC = 1$ (given) and $EB = \\sqrt{2^2+3^2} = \\sqrt{13}$ (Pythagorean Theorem).Now all we need is to find the height of $EBCHM$, which we can denote as $h$. We know that the length of the altitude from $M$, $F$, and $G$ to base $EBCH$ is $h$, and that's the length that will be easiest to use to find the height. To make this problem simpler, you can turn this 3D model into a 2D one (look at face $EABF$ ).Looking at face $EABF$, $h$ would be equal to the length of the altitude from $F$ to $EB$. To find this, we can find the coordinates of $F$ and the point where the altitude from $F$ touches $EB$, which we will call point $X$. Immediately, we know that the coordinates of $F$ are $(3,2)$, given the values on the rectangle, and we can find the coordinates of point $X$ by first noticing that the equation of $EB$ is $y = \\dfrac{-2x}{3}+2$. Because of perpendicular slopes being the inverse reciprocal of the original slope, the equation for FX is $y = \\dfrac{3x}{2}-\\dfrac{5}{2}$. From this, $y = \\dfrac{3x}{2}+b$, and $2=\\dfrac{3(3)}{2}+b$, so $b = \\dfrac{-5}{2}$. Now the intersection of these two equations can be found to be $(\\dfrac{27}{13},\\dfrac{8}{13})$. We can use the distance formula to find the distance between the two points. $\\sqrt{(3-\\dfrac{27}{13})^2 + (2-\\dfrac{8}{13})^2} = \\sqrt{(\\dfrac{12}{13})^2+(\\dfrac{8}{13})^2} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{468}}{13}$.Now that we know the height length and base area of the pyramid $EBCHM$, we can use the volume formula for it: $\\dfrac{\\text{(base area)} \\cdot \\text{(height length)}}{3} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{468}}{13} \\cdot \\sqrt{13}}{3}$ $= \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 2}$~Nate1212121"

Then, since $D$ balances $A$ and $C$, we get $D = A + C = 2 + 1 = 3$ (by mass points addition).Next, since $E$ balances $B$ and $D$ in a ratio of $BE:DE=1:1$, we know that $B=D=3$. Similarly, by mass points addition, $E=B+D=3+3=6$.Finally, $F$ balances $B$ and $C$ so $F=B+C=3+1=4$. We can confirm we have done everything right by noting that $E$ balances $A$ and $F$, so $E$ should equal $A+F$, which it does.Now that our points have weights, we can solve the problem. $BF:FC=1:3$ so $BF:BC=1:4$ so $[ABF]=\\frac{1}{4}[ABC]=90$.

Then, we need to subtract out the overlapped parts of the cubes. Between each consecutive pair of cubes, one of the smaller cube's faces is completely covered, along with an equal area of one of the larger cube's faces. The total area of the overlapped parts of the cubes is thus equal to $2\\sum_{n=1}^{6} n^2 = 182$.

      "[asy] size(10cm); Label f; f.p=fontsize(6); xaxis(-6,6,Ticks(f, 2.0)); yaxis(-6,6,Ticks(f, 2.0)); filldraw(origin--(4,0)--(0,3)--cycle, gray, black+linewidth(1)); [/asy]First, any combination of motions we can make must reflect $T$ an even number of times. This is because every time we reflect $T$, it changes orientation. Once $T$ has been flipped once, no combination of rotations will put it back in place because it is the mirror image; however, flipping it again changes it back to the original orientation. Since we are only allowed $3$ transformations and an even number of them must be reflections, we either reflect $T$ $0$ times or $2$ times.Case 1: $0$ reflections on $T$.In this case, we must use $3$ rotations to return $T$ to its original position. Notice that our set of rotations, $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$, contains every multiple of $90^\\circ$ except for $0^\\circ$. We can start with any two rotations $a,b$ in $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ and there must be exactly one $c \\equiv -a - b \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ such that we can use the three rotations $(a,b,c)$ which ensures that $a + b + c \\equiv 0^\\circ \\pmod{360^\\circ}$. That way, the composition of rotations $a,b,c$ yields a full rotation. For example, if $a = b = 90^\\circ$, then $c \\equiv -90^\\circ - 90^\\circ = -180^\\circ \\pmod{360^\\circ}$, so $c = 180^\\circ$ and the rotations $(90^\\circ,90^\\circ,180^\\circ)$ yields a full rotation.The only case in which this fails is when $c$ would have to equal $0^\\circ$. This happens when $(a,b)$ is already a full rotation, namely, $(a,b) = (90^\\circ,270^\\circ),(180^\\circ,180^\\circ),$ or $(270^\\circ,90^\\circ)$. However, we can simply subtract these three cases from the total. Selecting $(a,b)$ from $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ yields $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ choices, and with $3$ that fail, we are left with $6$ combinations for case $1$.Case 2: $2$ reflections on $T$.In this case, we first eliminate the possibility of having two of the same reflection. Since two reflections across the x-axis maps $T$ back to itself, inserting a rotation before, between, or after these two reflections would change $T$ 's final location, meaning that any combination involving two reflections across the x-axis would not map $T$ back to itself. The same applies to two reflections across the y-axis.Therefore, we must use one reflection about the x-axis, one reflection about the y-axis, and one rotation. Since a reflection about the x-axis changes the sign of the y component, a reflection about the y-axis changes the sign of the x component, and a $180^\\circ$ rotation changes both signs, these three transformation composed (in any order) will suffice. It is therefore only a question of arranging the three, giving us $3! = 6$ combinations for case 2.Combining both cases we get $6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 12}$.",
      "As in the previous solution, note that we must have either $0$ or $2$ reflections because of orientation since reflection changes orientation that is impossible to fix by rotation. We also know we can't have the same reflection twice, since that would give a net of no change and would require an identity rotation.Suppose there are no reflections. Denote $90^{\\circ}$ as $1$, $180^{\\circ}$ as $2$, and $270^{\\circ}$ as $3$, just for simplification purposes. We want a combination of $3$ of these that will sum to either $4$ or $8$ ( $0$ and $12$ are impossible since the minimum is $3$ and the max is $9$ ). $4$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(1-1-2)$ and $8$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(2-3-3)$. This case can be done in $3+3=6$ ways.Suppose there are two reflections. As noted already, they must be different, and as a result will take the triangle to the opposite side of the origin if we don't do any rotation. We have $1$ rotation left that we can do though, and the only one that will return to the original position is $2$, which is $180^{\\circ}$ AKA reflection across origin. Therefore, since all $3$ transformations are distinct. The three transformations can be applied anywhere since they are commutative (think quadrants). This gives $6$ ways.$6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 12}$.",
      "Define $s$ as a reflection, and $r$ as a $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation. Thus, $r^4=s^2=e$, and the five transformations can be represented as ${r, r^2, r^3, r^2s, s}$, and $rs=sr^{-1}$.Now either $s$ doesn't appear at all or appears twice. For the former case, it's easy to see that only $r, r, r^2$ and $r^2, r^3, r^3$ will work. Both can be permuted in $3$ ways, giving $6$ ways in total.For the latter case, note that $s$ can't appear twice, neither does $r^2s$, else we need to get $e$ from ${r, r^2, r^3}$, which is not possible. So $r^2s$ and $s$ must appear once each. The last transformation must be $r^2$. A quick check shows that ${r^2, r^2s, s}$ is permutable, since $r^2s=sr^{-2}=sr^2$ (since $r^4=e$ ). This gives $6$ ways.Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 12}$.~Xrider100"

      "The slope of the line is $\\frac{3}{5}$. We must transform it by $45^{\\circ}$.$45^{\\circ}$ creates an isosceles right triangle, since the sum of the angles of the triangle must be $180^{\\circ}$ and one angle is $90^{\\circ}$. This means the last leg angle must also be $45^{\\circ}$.In the isosceles right triangle, the two legs are congruent. We can therefore construct an isosceles right triangle with a line of $\\frac{3}{5}$ slope on graph paper. That line with $\\frac{3}{5}$ slope starts at $(0,0)$ and will go to $(5,3)$, the vector $<5, 3 >$.Construct another line from $(0,0)$ to $(3,-5)$, the vector $<3,-5>$. This is $\\perp$ and equal to the original line segment. The difference between the two vectors is $<2,8>$, which is the slope $4$, and that is the slope of line $k$.Furthermore, the equation $3x-5y+40=0$ passes straight through $(20,20)$ since $3(20)-5(20)+40=60-100+40=0$, which means that any rotations about $(20,20)$ would contain $(20,20)$.

      "First note that the given line goes through $(20,20)$ with a slope of $\\frac{3}{5}$. This means that $(25,23)$ is on the line.

      "Converting to the complex plane, we can see that two numbers on the line are $8i$ and $5+11i$. Translating $20+20i$ to the origin, we get $8i-20-20i = -20-12i$ and $5+11i-20-20i = -15-9i$. Multiplying each of them by $e^{\\pi i/4}$, we get $-4\\sqrt 2 - 16 \\sqrt2 i$ and $-3\\sqrt 2 - 12 \\sqrt 2 i$. This line has a slope of $4$. Now, back to the cartesian plane. We have a line passing through $(20, 20)$ with slope $4$ which gives the equation as $y = 4x-60$ which implies the $x$ coordinate of the $x$ intercept is $60/4 = 15$.~rocketsri (minor error corrected by kn07)",
      "A quick check tells us that $(20,20)$ falls on the given line. Common sense tells us that if the slope of the original line is $1$, or 45 degrees from the horizontal, a 45 counter clockwise rotation will result in a vertical line, and the x-intercept will be $(20,0)$.\nThinking of a 45 degree counter clockwise rotation as a 90 degree counter clockwise rotation that is bisected will helps in visualizing this line of reasoning.\nTherefore, it follows that if the original line is made steeper, then the x-intercept will move away from $(20,0)$ to the right. If the original line is made lower, then the opposite will happen. Our given line has slope $3/5$, so the answer must be $A$ or $B$. $A$ can be eliminated because an x-intercept of $(10,0)$ can only occur when the original line is horizontal.

Letting the side length be $a$, we can create a square of length $s$ around it (see figure).\n\n[asy] draw((1, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, 1)--(2.41421356, -1)--(1, -2.41421356)--(-1, -2.41421356)--(-2.41421356, -1)--(-2.41421356, 1)--(-1, 2.41421356)--cycle); label(\"a\",(1, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, 1),S); draw((-2.41421356, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, -2.41421356)--(-2.41421356, -2.41421356)--cycle); label(\"s\",(-2.41421356, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, 2.41421356),N); [/asy]Creating a small square of side length $a$ from the corners of this figure gives us an area of $a^2$. Thus, $s^2 - a^2 = n$ where $n$ is the area of the octagon. We know from the Pythagorean Theorem that $s = a + \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$, meaning that $n = (a + \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 - a^2 = 2a^2(1+\\sqrt{2})$.Dividing this by $8$ gives us the area of each triangular segment which makes up the octagon. Further dividing by $2$ gives us the area of a smaller segment consisting of the right triangle with legs of the apothem and $\\frac{a}{2}$. Using the area of a triangle as $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, we can determine the length of apothem $r$ from\\[\\frac{2a^2(1+\\sqrt{2})}{8 \\times 2} = \\frac{\\frac{a}{2}\\times r}{2}\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{4a^2(1+\\sqrt{2})}{8 } = ar\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{a(1+\\sqrt{2})}{2} = r\\]\n\n.From the apothem, we can once again use the Pythagorean Theorem, giving us the length of the circumradius $R$.\\[R^2 = (\\frac{a(1+\\sqrt{2})}{2})^2 + (\\frac{a}{2})^2\\]\n\n\n\\[R^2 = \\frac{a^2(1+\\sqrt{2})^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}\\]\n\n\n\\[R^2 = \\frac{a^2(3+2\\sqrt{2})}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}\\]\n\n\n\\[R^2 = \\frac{a^2(4+2\\sqrt{2})}{4}\\]\n\n\n\\[R = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2(4+2\\sqrt{2})}{4}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt2}}{2}\\]\n\n.Doubling this gives us the diagonal of both the square and the octagon. From here, we can use the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}d^2$ for the area of the square:\\[A = \\frac{(a\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt2})^2}{2}\\]\n\n\n\\[A = \\frac{a^2(4+2\\sqrt{2})}{2} = m\\]\n\n.Thus we now only need to find the ratio $\\frac{m}{n}$. This can be easily done through some algebra:\\[\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{a^2(4+2\\sqrt{2})}{2(2a^2(1+\\sqrt{2})}\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{4+2\\sqrt{2}}{4+4\\sqrt{2}}\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{2+2\\sqrt{2}}\\]Rationalizing the denominator by multiplying by the conjugate, we get $\\frac{m}{n} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$. ~ciceronii",

      "This solution is quite efficient and unconvoluted. Though the explanation appears long, this is only because I have tried to make it very thorough.Because we are finding the ratios of the areas of the quadrilateral, and the octagon, let us assume, for simplicity's sake, that the octagon has side length $1$. Call $O$ the center of the octagon. Because it is a regular octagon, $\\angle AOB$ is $\\frac{360}{8}=45$.\nDraw the apothem, and call where it intersects $AB$, $I$. As the apothem bisects $\\angle AOB$, $\\angle AIB$ is $\\frac{45}{2}=22.5$.\nThen, as the apothem is perpendicular to $AB$, $\\angle IBO$ is $90-22.5=67.5$. As the apothem bisects $AB$, segment $IB$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the apothem has length $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{tan}(67.5)$. By the formula $\\text{area} = \\text{apothem} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{perimeter}}{2}$, the area of the octagon is then $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{tan}(67.5) \\cdot \\frac{8}{2}$.Now, we move on to the quadrilateral. Let us take triangle $AGH$. By the interior angle formula, $m \\angle AGH = \\frac{180 (8-2)}{8} = 135$. Because the octagon is regular, $AGH$ is isosceles, with assumed sidelength $1$. Drop an altitude from $H$ to $AG$, and call the intersection point, $P$. As $AGH$ is isosceles, this altitude bisects both segment $AG$ and angle $AHG$. Thus, the $m \\angle AHP = \\frac{135}{2} = 67.5$. Let us call the length of $AG$, which is also a side of the quadrilateral, $s$. Then, $AP$ is $\\frac{s}{2}$. Thus, $\\text{sin}(67.5) = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{1}$, so $s = 2 \\cdot \\text{sin}(67.5)$. We can do the same for each of the other sides of the quadrilateral and find that they are of the same length. One can easily see that triangle $ABC$ is congruent to triangle $AGH$. Because triangle $AGH$ is isosceles, $m \\angle HAG = \\frac{180-135}{2} = 22.5$. The same can be said of angles $BAC$. Thus, angle $CAG$, an interior angle of the quadrilateral is $90$. We can do the same for the other interior angles of $CEGA$ and find that they are also $90$. Thus, $CEGA$ is a square, so its area is $s^2 = 4 \\cdot \\text{sin}^2(67.5)$.Now, we must find the ratios of the two areas.\n$\\frac{\\text{Area(quadrilateral)}}{\\text{Area(hexagon)}} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{sin}^2(67.5)}{2\\cdot \\text{tan}(67.5)} =frac{2\\cdot \\text{sin}^2(67.5)}{\\frac{\\text{sin}(67.5)}{\\text{cos}(67.5)}} = 2\\cdot \\text{sin}(67.5) \\cdot \\text{cos}(67.5) = \\text{sin} (135) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, the answer.-jyatvitskiy\u00a0:)",

Note that both triangles are right, since their hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle. Therefore, $CE=AE=\\sqrt{d^2-12}$. We know this since $OC=OA=OB$ and $OC$ is the hypotenuse of a $30-60-90$ right triangle, with the longer leg being $\\frac{6}{2}=3$ so $OC=2\\sqrt{3}$.

This is nice as it\u2019s also the smallest value, solidifying our answer.You can also simply brute-force it or sort of think ahead - for example, getting from A to M can be done $2$ ways; $A \\rightarrow X \\rightarrow M$ ( $5+2$ ) or $A \\rightarrow M (8)$, so you should take the shorter route ( $5+2$ ). Another example is M to C, two ways - one is $6+5$ and the other is $14$. Take the shorter route. After this, you need to consider a few more times - consider if $5+10$ ( $Y \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow Z$ ) is greater than $17 (Y \\rightarrow Z$ ), which it is not, and consider if $25 (M \\rightarrow Z$ ) is greater than $14+10$ ( $M \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow Z$ ) or $6+5+10$ ( $M \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow Z$ ) which it is not.

This effectively proves that, assuming we execute the algorithm correctly, that we will have found the shortest distance.

Consider the outgoing edges $(A,X)$ and $(A,M)$ and update the distance estimates $d(X)=5$ and $d(M)=8$, completing the first row of the table.The node $X$ is the unvisited node with the lowest distance estimate, so we will consider $X$ and its outgoing edges $(X,Y)$ and $(X,M)$. The distance estimate $d(Y)$ equals $d(X)+10=15$, and the distance estimate $d(M)$ updates to $d(X)+2=7$, because $7 < 8$. This completes the second row of the table.

The region between the two smaller circles is shaded, as is the portion of the region between the two larger circles bounded by central angles $BOC$, as shown in the figure below. Suppose the shaded and unshaded regions are equal in area. What is the measure of $\\angle{BOC}$ in degrees?",

      "Let $x=\\angle{BOC}$.We see that the shaded region is the inner ring plus a sector $x^\\circ$ of the outer ring. Using the formula for the area of a circle ( $A = \\pi r^2$ ), we find that the area of $x$ is $\\left( 4 \\pi - \\pi \\right)+\\frac{x}{360} \\left( 9 \\pi - 4 \\pi \\right)$.

Credit goes to MrThinker for the solution and explanation.)",
      "Notice that for the 3rd most outer ring of the circle, the ratio of the shaded region to non-shaded region is the ratio of $\\angle{BOC}$ to $360-\\angle{BOC}$. With that, all we need to do is solve for the shaded region.The inner most circle has radius $1$, and the second circle has radius 2. Therefore, the first shaded area has $4 \\pi - \\pi = 3 \\pi$ area. The circle has total area $9 \\pi$, so the other shaded region must have $1.5 \\pi$ area, as the non-shaded and shaded area is equivalent. So for the 3rd outer ring, the total area is $9 \\pi - 4 \\pi = 5 \\pi$, so the non-shaded part of the outer ring is $5 \\pi - 1.5 \\pi = 3.5 \\pi$.Now as said before, the ratio of these two areas is the ratio of $\\angle{BOC}$ and $360 - \\angle{BOC}$. So, $\\frac{3.5}{1.5} = \\frac{7}{3}$. We have $7x:3x$ where $7x+3x = 360$, $x = 36$, so our answer is $3x = 108, \\boxed{(A) 108}$.~MaxyMoosy",

      "Suppose the desired angle is some fraction $x$ of the total degree measure of the circle. We now compile a list of the shaded and unshaded areas.

The inner annulus has area $2^2 - 1^2 = 3$, which it contributes to the shaded area. The outer annulus has a total area of $3^2 - 2^2 = 5$ ; the fraction $x$ is shaded, so the shaded portion of the outer annulus contributes $5x$ to the shaded area, while the other $1 - x$ fraction is unshaded, so the unshaded portion contributes $5(1-x)$ to the unshaded area. We now equate and solve.\n\n\\[1 + 5(1-x) = 3 + 5x\\]\n\nUpon solving, we find that $x = \\frac{3}{10}$, so the degree measure is $360 \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 108}$.~ cxsmi"

      "Let $a$ be the length of the shorter base, and let $b$ be the length of the longer one. Note that these two parameters, along with the angle measures and the fact that the trapezoid is isosceles, uniquely determine a trapezoid. We drop perpendiculars down from the endpoints of the top base. Then the length from the foot of this perpendicular to either vertex will be half the difference between the lengths of the two bases, or $\\frac{b-a}{2}$. Now, since we have a 30-60-90 triangle and this side length corresponds to the \"30\" part, the length of the hypotenuse (one of the legs) is $2 \\cdot \\frac{b-a}{2} = b-a$. Then the perimeter of the trapezoid is $2(b-a)+a+b=3b-a=30$. The only other stipulation for this trapezoid to be valid is that $b>a$ (which was our assumption). We can now easily count the valid pairs $(a,b)$, yielding $(3,11),(6,12),(9,13),(12,14)$.

We want $\\frac{30-3x}{2}$ to be a positive integer so b is a positive integer. 30 is a multiple of 3 and $-3x$ is just subtracting multiples of 3's from 30 so every number on the numerator of $\\frac{30-3x}{2}$ is a multiple of 3 under 30 ( $x$ is also a positive integer so it can't be larger than 30 or not be a multiple of 3). For $30-3x$ to be divisible by 2 it must be even, so we are finding even multiples of 3 under 30 which are 24, 18, 12, and 6. Each number will give us a valid $x$ and a valid $b$ pair giving us 4 solutions.~happymaths",

      "Since the trapezoid perimeter is $30$, we can name the top, congruent side lengths, and bottom variables. The top length is $A$, the congruent side length is $C$, and the bottom should be $B$.

The perimeter of the trapezoid is $2A + 2B + 2C = 30,$ which can be divided by $2$ to become $A + B + C = 15$ Now, since the $B$ is the base of a 30-60-90 right triangle, and its angle opposite to the side is $30$ degrees. Therefore, $B$ is exactly half of side $C$. We can test out cases of $B$. If $B = 1$, then $C = 2$, $A + 1 + 2 = 15$ which would give $A$ the value of $12$.

      "Explanations and Reasoning to Similar SolutionsNote that trapezoid $ABCD$ is isosceles with $B$ and $C$ being the bottom 2 vertices. The shape can be dissected into 3 shapes with 2 congruent right triangles separated by a rectangle. This is done by dropping an altitude, a perpendicular point on the base from each of the 2 top vertices, named $E$ and $F$, respectively below $A$ and $D$. The property that angles $\\angle$ $B$ and $\\angle$ $C$ measure $60^\\circ$ is significant here, forming $30-60-90$ triangles ( $\\triangle$ $ABE$ and $\\triangle$ $DCF$ ). Now the assumed larger $^a$ side $BC$ is separated into 3 sections by the 3 shapes. Or $BC = BE + EF + CF$. $^b$ Recall that $\\triangle$ $ABE$ and $\\triangle$ $DCF$ are $30-60-90$ triangles, the side length ratios are $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Naming the length of the shorter side of the right triangles as $a$, and the length of side $AD$ as $b$, then the trapezoid's side lengths can be expressed in only 2 variables. Now knowing $AD = b$, $DC = 2a$ $^c$, $BC = a + b + a = 2a + b$, and $AC = 2a$, the perimeter is $b + 2a + 2a + b + 2a = 2b + 6a = 30$. Simplifying, $3a + b = 15$, only 4 pairs of values satisfy this condition, namely $(1,12)$, $(2,9)$, $(3,6)$, $(4,3)$.Thus there $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}~4}$ possible non-congruent trapezoids.$^a$ The question asks for non-congruent trapezoids, and rotation preserves congruence so the assumption is always true WLOG.$^b$ The shortest side of $\\triangle$ ABE, the length of AD (shape ADFE is a rectangle so FE = AD), and the shortest side of $\\triangle$ DCF.$^c$ $AB = DC = 2a$, $AB$ and $DC$ are the hypotenuse of triangles $\\triangle$ ABE and $\\triangle$ DCF.\n~moracle",
