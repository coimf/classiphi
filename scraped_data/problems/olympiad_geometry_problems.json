We denote the catheti of the triangle as $a$ and $b$. We also observe the well-known fact that in a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is of half the length of the hypotenuse. (This is true because if we inscribe the triangle in a circle, the hypotenuse is the diameter, so a segment from any point on the circle to the midpoint of the hypotenuse is a radius.)", "answer_choices": "frq", "answer": "", "solutions": ["The conditions of the problem require thatHowever, we notice that twice the area of the triangle $abc$ is $ab$, since $a$ and $b$ form a right angle. However, twice the area of the triangle is also the product of $c$ and the altitude to $c$. Hence the altitude to $c$ must have length $\\frac{c}{4}$. Therefore if we construct a circle with diameter $c$ and a line parallel to $c$ and of distance $\\frac{c}{4}$ from $c$, either point of intersection between the line and the circle will provide a suitable third vertex for the triangle. Q.E.D.We denote the angle between $b$ and $c$ as $\\alpha$. The problem requires thator, equivalently, thatHowever, since $\\frac{a}{c} = \\sin{\\alpha};\\; \\frac{b}{c} = \\cos{\\alpha}$, we can rewrite the condition asor, equivalently, asFrom this it becomes apparent that $2\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ or $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ ; hence the other two angles in the triangle must be $\\frac{ \\pi }{12}$ and $\\frac{ 5 \\pi }{12}$, which are not difficult to construct. Q.E.D.Note. It is not difficult to reconcile these two constructions. Indeed, we notice that the altitude of the triangle is of length $c \\sin{\\alpha}\\cos{\\alpha}$, which both of the solutions set equal to $\\frac{c}{4}$.If we let the legs be $a$ and $b$ with $a < b$, then $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Because $c^2 = 4 a b$ as well, we immediately deduce via some short computations through quadratic formula that $a = (2 - \\sqrt{3})b$ and $a = (2 + \\sqrt{3})b$. Thus, $\\frac{a}{b} = \\tan 15^\\circ$ and $\\frac{a}{b} = \\tan 75^\\circ$, and so one of the angles of the triangle must be $15^\\circ$ and the other must be $75^\\circ$. A $15^\\circ$ angle is easily constructed by bisecting a $30^\\circ$ angle (which is formed by constructing the altitude of an equilateral triangle), and $75^\\circ$ angle is constructed by constructing a 15 degree angle on top of the 60 degree point.We draw perpendicular $h$ on $c$ and denote the angle between the median and $c$ as $\\alpha$. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{ab}{2}$ or $\\frac{ch}{2}$We can write $c$ as $2\\sqrt{ab}$ So we have,\\[\\frac{ab}{2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{ab}h}{2}\\]Which simplifies to be\\[\\frac{\\sqrt{ab}}{h} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nOr\\[\\sin\\alpha = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\]So, we draw $c$ and from it's midpoint, we draw a segment $\\frac{c}{2}$ forming an angle $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$\nJoin the vertices to get the required triangle.This is a geometric solution. We start with some observations in the first paragraph and describe the construction in the next paragraph. Consider any right triangle with hypotenuse c. Construct square with side length c on the opposite side of c from the triangle. Construct 3 more triangles congruent to the original triangle on the outside of each of the three other sides of the square in such a way that a larger square with side length a+b is formed. The area of this larger square is c^2+2ab = 1.5c^2 so a+b = (3/2)^(1/2) *cNow go back to the given c. Construct a square with side length c first. Let two adjacent corners of it be M and N. Construct the square's diagonals and let center of the square be O. Construct a circle around O with radius (3/2)^(1/2) * OM. To do so, take OM, first draw a 2:1 right triangle with OM being the short side to obtain a hypothenuse with length 3^(1/2) OM, then draw a 1:1 right triangle from that side to obtain a hypothenuse with length 6^(1/2)*OM. then bisect it for desired length. Next draw the circular locus of points X such that MXO is 45 degrees. To accomplish this, simply find the point on the perpendicular bisector of OM that is 1/(2OM) from OM. There are two such points, pick the one closer to N. Draw circle around this new point going through O and M. The intersection of the two circles is the desired third vertex of the triangle with the given hypotenuse c."]}, "1959_imo_problems/problem_5": {"id": {"year": 1959, "contest_name": "IMO", "problem_number": 5}, "title": "1959 IMO Problems/Problem 5", "problem": "An arbitrary point $M$ is selected in the interior of the segment $AB$.

Let $\\theta$ be the angle with arms $AO$ and $AA_1$, where $O$ is the center of the circle; $0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.We have $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{r}{a}$ \u00a0; $0 < \\tan \\theta < 1$. For the two volumes we have $V_2 = \\pi r^2 \\times 2r = 2\\pi r^3$ and $V_1 = \\frac{\\pi a^2 \\times H_1 H_2}{3} = \\frac{\\pi a^3 \\tan (\\angle A_1 A H_1) }{3}$.Knowing $\\angle A_1 A H_1 = 2 \\times \\angle A_1 A O = 2 \\theta$, and using the formula for a double-angle tangent, we can simplify the result:$V_1 = \\frac{\\pi a^3 \\tan (\\angle A_1 A H_1)}{3}$$V_1 = \\frac{2 \\pi r^3 \\tan \\theta}{3 \\tan^3 \\theta (1 - \\tan^2 \\theta)}$$V_1 = k V_2$, where $k = \\frac{1}{3\\tan^2 \\theta (1 - \\tan^2 \\theta)}$We see that the biquadratic equation $3 \\tan^4 \\theta - 3 \\tan^2 \\theta + 1 = 0$ has no real roots for $\\tan \\theta$, which means that $k \\neq 1$. Therefore $V_1 \\neq V_2$.Part b):Let $\\tan^2 \\theta = x; 0 < x < 1$. Consider the function $f(x) = 3x - 3x^2$. The coefficient in front of $x^2$ is negative, which means the function has an upper bound, i.e. k has a lower bound (since it is the reciprocal of $f(x)$ ). Using the vertex formula for a quadratic function, we get $x = -\\frac{b}{2a} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which gives us $f(x) = y_{max} = \\frac{3}{4}$. From there $k_{min} = \\frac{4}{3}$.For $\\tan^2 \\theta$ we have $\\tan^2 \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}; \\tan \\theta = +/- \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$. We defined $\\tan \\theta$ to be in the interval (0;1), so $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$. That gives us $\\tan \\angle A_1 A H_1 = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{2}}{7}$.

We do\nthis to convey the idea of the proof, and because we will use this\nin one spot in proving the 3-dimensional case. So let us prove that:The sum of the distances of the vertices of an equilateral triangle\n$\\triangle ABC$ from the center $O$ of its circumscribed circle is\nless than the sum of the distances of these vertices from any other\npoint $P$ in the plane.We will do the proof in three steps:$\\mathbf{1.}$ We will show that if $P$ is in one of the exterior\nregions, then there is a point $P_1$ on the boundary of the triangle\n(a vertex, or on a side), such that $PA + PB + PC > P_1A + P_1B + P_1C$.$\\mathbf{2.}$ Then we will show that if $P$ is on the boundary, then\n$PA + PB + PC > OA + OB + OC$.$\\mathbf{3.}$ For the final step, we will show that if $P$ is a point\nof minimum for $PA + PB + PC$ inside the triangle, then the extensions\nof $PA, PB, PC$ are perpendicular to the opposite sides $BC, AC, AB$.\nThis implies that $P = O$.$\\mathbf{Proof\\ of\\ 1:}$ If the point $P$ is outside the triangle,\nit can be in one of six regions as seen in the pictures below.If $P$ is in a region delimited by extensions of two sides of the\ntriangle, as in the picture on the left, we notice that by taking\n$P_1 = A$, $PA + PB + PC > P_1A + P_1B + P_1C$ (because $P_1A = 0$\nand $P_1B < PB$ as sides in an obtuse triangles, and similarly\n$P_1C < PC$ ).If $P$ is in a region delimited by a segment which is a side of the\ntriangle and by the extensions of two sides, as in the picture on\nthe right, take $P_1 =$ the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to\n$AB$. Then $PA + PB + PC > P_1A + P_1B + P_1C$ (because the triangle\n$\\triangle PP_1C$ is obtuse, and because the triangles\n$\\triangle PP_1A, \\triangle PP_1B$ are right triangles).$\\mathbf{Proof\\ of\\ 2:}$ Now assume that $P_1 = A$. A direct, simple\ncomputation shows that $P_1A + P_1B + P_1C > OA + OB + OC$ (indeed, if\nwe take the side of the triangle to be $1$, then $P_1A + P_1B + P_1C = 2$,\nand $OA + OB + OC = 3 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\sqrt{3}$ ).Now assume that $P_1$ is on $AB$. If $P_1$ is not the midpoint of $AB$,\nlet $P_2$ be the midpoint. Then $P_1A + P_1B + P_1C > P_2A + P_2B + P_2C$\n(because $P_1A + P_1B = P_2A + P_2B = AB$ and $P_1C > P_2C$ ). A direct,\nsimple computation shows that $P_2A + P_2B + P_2C > OA + OB + OC$ (indeed,\nif we take the side of the triangle to be $1$,\n$P_2A + P_2B + P_2C = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $OA + OB + OC = \\sqrt{3}$ ).$\\mathbf{Proof\\ of\\ 3:}$ Assume that $P$ is inside the triangle\n$\\triangle ABC$. In this case, we make a proof by contradiction. We\nwill show that if $P$ is a point where $PA + PB + PC$ is minimum, then\nthe extensions of $PA, PB, PC$ are perpendicular to the opposite sides\n$BC, AC, AB$. (This statement implies that $P = O$.) If this were not\ntrue, at least one of $PA \\perp BC, PB \\perp AC, PC \\perp AB$ would be\nfalse. We can assume that $PC$ is not perpendicular to $AB$. Then draw\nthe ellipse with focal points $A, B$ which goes through $P$.Now consider the point $P_1$ on the ellipse such that $CP_1 \\perp AB$.\nBecause of the properties of the ellipse, $CP_1 < CP$, and because of\nthe definition of the ellipse $PA + PB = P_1A + P_1B$. We conclude that\n$PA + PB + PC > P_1A + P_1B + P_1C$, which contradicts the assumption\nthat $P$ was such that $PA + PB + PC$ was minimum.This proves the 2-dimensional case.NOTE: a very picky reader might object that the proof used that\na minimum of $PA + PB + PC$ exists, and is achieved at a point $P$\ninside the triangle. This can be justified simply by noting that\n$PA + PB + PC > 0$ and quoting the theorem from calculus (or is it\ntopology?) which says that a continuous function on a closed, bounded\nset has a minimum, and there is a point where the minimum is achieved.\nBecause of the arguments in the proof, this point can not be on the\nboundary of the triangle, so it is inside.Now we will give the proof in the 3-dimensional case. We will do the\nproof in three steps. It is extremely similar to the proof in the\n2-dimensional case, we just need to go from 2D to 3D, so I will skip\nsome details.$\\mathbf{1.}$ We will show that if $P$ is in one of the exterior regions,\nthen there is a point $P_!$ on the boundary of the tetrahedron (a vertex,\nor on a edge, or on a side, such that\n$PA + PB + PC + PD > P_1A + P_1B + P_1C + P_1D$.$\\mathbf{2.}$ Then we will show that if $P$ is on the boundary, then\n$PA + PB + PC + PD > OA + OB + OC + OD$.$\\mathbf{3.}$ For the final step, consider the plane going through\nthe edge $CD$ perpendicular to the edge $AB$, the plane going through\n$AB$ perpendicular to $CD$, the plane going through $CA$ perpendicular\nto $BD$, etc. There are six such planes, and they all contain $O$,\nthe center of the circumscribed sphere. We will show that if $P$ is\na point of minimum for $PA + PB + PC + PD$ inside the tetrahedron,\nthen $P$ is in each of the six planes described above. This implies\nthat $P = O$.$\\mathbf{Proof\\ of\\ 1:}$ Let $P$ be in one of the exterior regions.\nAssume $P$ is in a prism shaped region delimited by extensions of\nthree sides meeting in a vertex (there are 4 of them). Assume it\nis at vertex $A$, the sides being the extensions of planes\n$ABC, ABD, ACD$. Then take $P_1 = A$. We have\n$PA + PB + PC + PD > P_1A + P_1B + P_1C + P_1D$ because of obtuse\ntriangles formed with $PP_1$.Now assume $P$ is in one of the wedge shaped regions, formed by an\nedge and the extensions of two sides going through them. (there are\nsix such regions.) Assume this is the line $AB$ and the extensions\nof $ABC, ABD$. Then take $P_1$ to be the foot of the perpendicular\nfrom $P$ to $AB$. Again, we have the desired inequality because\n$PP_1$ formed some right and obtuse triangles.Now assume $P$ is in the truncated prism region delimited by a side\nand the extensions of the faces going through the edges of this side.\n(There are four such regions.) Assume this is the side $ABC$, and\nextensions of the sides $DAB, DBC, DCA$. Then take $P_1$ to be the\nfoot of the perpendicular from $P$ to the plane $ABC$. Again, we\nhave the desired inequality because of right and obtuse triangles\nformed by $PP_1$.$\\mathbf{Proof\\ of\\ 2:}$ Assume $P_1 = A$. If we take the edge of\nthe tetrahedron to be $1$, a direct computation gives us that\n$P_1A + P_1B + P_1C + P_1D = 3$, and\n$OA + OB + OC + OD = 4 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{4} = \\sqrt{6}$.Assume $P_1$ is on $AB$. If $P_1$ is not the midpoint of $AB$, take\n$P_2$ to be the midpoint of $AB$. Then\n$P_1A + P_1B + P_1C + P_1D > P_2A + P_2B + P_2C + P_2D$ because of\nright triangles formed by $P_2C, P_2D$. And, if we take the edge of\nthe tetrahedron to be $1$, a direct computation yields that\n$P_2A + P_2B + P_2C + P_2D = 1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 + \\sqrt{3}$,\nwhich is bigger than $OA + OB + OC + OD = \\sqrt{6}$.Assume $P_1$ is on $ABC$. If $P_1$ is not the circumcenter of\n$\\triangle ABC$ then take $P_2$ to be the circumcenter. We have\n$P_1D > P_2D$ because $P_2D \\perp ABC$. We also have\n$P_1A + P_1B + P_1C > P_2A + P_2B + P_2C$ because we proved the\n2-dimensional analogue of the problem. And, if we take the edge\nof the tetrahedron to be $1$, we have\n$P_2A + P_2B + P_2C + P_2D = \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$, which\nis bigger than $OA + OB + OC + OD = \\sqrt{6}$.NOTE: In the above paragraph, we used that the similar result\nis true in the 2-dimensional case, with an equilateral triangle\ninstead of a regular tetrahedron.NOTE: This part of the proof concludes filling in the gap in the\nfirst \"Solution\", written above. (A reader may complain that the\nproof in Solution 2 is very long (compared to the first \"Solution\"),\nbut the first \"Solution\" should have done this too, one way or\nanother.)$\\mathbf{Proof\\ of\\ 3:}$ Now consider the six planes going through\none edge, perpendicular to the opposite edge. They intersect at\nthe circumcenter of the tetrahedron. Assume $P$ is a point in the\ninterior of the tetrahedron where $PA + PB + PC + PD$ achieves its\nminimum value. Then $P$ is in each of the six plane.Prove this statement by contradiction. Assume that there is\na plane among the six, so that $P$ is not on it. Assume the\nplane is the one going through $CD$, perpendicular to $AB$.\nTo make it more explicit, this is the plane going through\n$C, D, E$, where $E$ is the midpoint of $AB$.Consider the ellipsoid with focal points $A, B$ going through $P$.\nThis can be obtained as the set of points $Q$ in space so that\n$QA + QB = PA + PB$. It can also be obtained as the surface\nobtained when we form the ellipse with focal points $A, B$ in\nthe plane $ABC$ (as the set of points $Q$ so that\n$QA + QB = PA + PB$ ), and we rotate this ellipse from the plane\n$ABC$ around its axis $AB$. Let $P_1$ be the foot of the\nperpendicular from $P$ to the plane $CDE$. We have\n$PC > P_1C, PD > P_1D$ because $PP_1 \\perp CDE$. We also have\n$PA + PB > P_1A + P_1B$ because $P_1$ is in the interior of the\nellipsoid. (Indeed, the intersection of the plane $CDE$ and the\nellipsoid is the circle generated by rotating the ends of the\nsmall axis of the ellipse in the plane $ABC$. Since the point\n$P$ is not on the plane CDE, it must be on a smaller circle, so\nits projection to the plane $CDE$ will be inside.)This concludes the proof of the problem.[Solution by pf02, September 2024]"]}, "1966_imo_problems/problem_6": {"id": {"year": 1966, "contest_name": "IMO", "problem_number": 6}, "title": "1966 IMO Problems/Problem 6", "problem": "In the interior of sides $BC, CA, AB$ of triangle $ABC$, any points $K, L,M$, respectively, are selected.

We get a set of tetrahedrons, two of which, $ABC_1D$ and\n$ABC_2D$ are shown in the picture below. The lengths of all sides\nexcept $CD$ are constant through this transformation.1. Assume that the angles between the planes $ABD$ and $ABC$, and $ABD$\nand $ABC_1$ are both acute. If the perpendicular from $C_1$ to the\nplane $ABD$ is larger that the perpendicular from $C$ to the plane\n$ABD$ then the volume of $ABC_1D$ is larger than the volume of $ABCD$.2. Furthermore, the tetrahedron $ABC_2D$ obtained when the position of\n$C_2$ is such that the planes $ABD$ and $ABC_2$ are perpendicular has\nthe maximum volume of all tetrahedrons obtained from rotating\n$\\triangle ABC$ around $AB$.These statements are intuitively clear, since the volume $V$ of the\ntetrahedron $ABCD$ is given by$V = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot ($ area of $\\triangle ABD) \\cdot ($ height from $C)$.A formal proof is very easy, and I will skip it.Given a tetrahedron $T$, and an edge $e_1$ of it, we can find another\ntetrahedron $U$ such that $\\mathbf{volume}(U) > \\mathbf{volume}(T)$,\nwith an edge $f_1 > e_1$, and such that all the other edges of $U$\nare equal to the corresponding edges of $T$, $\\mathbf{unless}$ the\nedge $e_1$ stretches between sides of $T$ which are perpendicular.\nWhen we chose a bigger $f_1$, if $e_1 < 1$ we can choose $f_1 = 1$.\nOr, we can choose $f_1$ such that it stretches between sides which\nare perpendicular.(By \"stretches between two sides\" I mean that the end points of the\nedge are the vertices on the two sides which are not common to the\ntwo sides. In the picture above, $DC_2$ stretches between the sides\n$ABD, AC_2B$ of $ABC_2D$.)Assume we have a tetrahedron $T$ with edges $e_1, \\dots, e_6$, such\nthat $e_2, \\dots, e_6 \\le 1$. If there is an edge $e_m < 1$ among\n$e_2, \\dots, e_6$ then there is a tetrahedron $U$ with volume bigger\nthan the volume of $T$, whose edges are equal to those of $T$,\nexcept for $e_m$, which is replaced by an edge of size $1$.Case 1: If $T$ does not have any sides which are perpendicular, then\nthe existence of $U$ follows from the corollary.Case 2: Assume $T$ has exactly two sides which are perpendicular\n(like $ABC_2D$ in the picture above). If $C_2D < 1$ and it were\nthe only edge $< 1$, then all the other edges are $= 1$ (because\nthey were assumed to be $\\le 1$ ). In this case\n$\\triangle ABD, \\triangle AC_2B$ are equilateral with sides $= 1$,\nand the planes can not be perpendicular since $C_2D < 1$. (Indeed,\nan easy computation shows that if we take two equilateral triangles\n$\\triangle ABD, \\triangle AC_2B$ and place them perpendicular to each\nother, then $CD = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} > 1$.) So $e_m$ must be one of\nthe other sides. Then again, the existence of $U$ follows from the\ncorollary.Case 3: Assume that three sides are perpendicular.Assume the perpendicular sides are the ones meeting at $A$, i.e.\neach pair of the planes meeting at $A$ are perpendicular. Since\nat least two of the edges $BD, BC, CD \\le 1$ it follows that\n$AB, AC, AD < 1$ (the sides of the right angle in a right triangle\nare less than the hypotenuse). Just for the sake of notation,\nassume $e_m = AB < 1$. We can apply the corollary, and find a\ntetrahedron $U$ with volume bigger than the volume of $T$, with\nedges equal to those of $T$, except that $AB$ is replaced by an\nedge $= 1$.Now the problem is very easy to prove. Let $T$ be a tetrahedron\nwith edges $e_1, \\dots, e_6$, such that $e_2, \\dots, e_6 \\le 1$.\nApply the lemma as many times as necessary (up to five times),\nsuccessively replacing each edge $< 1$ by an edge $= 1$. We\nobtain a tetrahedron $U$ with five edges $f_2, \\dots, f_6 = 1$,\nand one edge $f_1 = e_1$. If $f_1$ stretches between two\nperpendicular sides, we are done. If not, apply the corollary\none more time to obtain a bigger tetrahedron in which $f_1$ is\nreplaced by a larger edge which stretches between two\nperpendicular sides.We obtain the same result as in the first solution: the largest\ntetrahedron is the one formed by two equilateral triangles with\nsides $= 1$, having one side in common, with the two planes\ncontaining the triangles perpendicular. An easy calculation\nshows that the edge which is $> 1$ is in fact of length\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}$, and the volume of this tetrahedron\nis $\\frac{1}{8}$.[Solution by pf02, September 2024]"]}, "1967_imo_problems/problem_4": {"id": {"year": 1967, "contest_name": "IMO", "problem_number": 4}, "title": "1967 IMO Problems/Problem 4", "problem": "Let $A_0B_0C_0$ and $A_1B_1C_1$ be any two acute-angled triangles.

In solution 2, I show where I use the condition that the triangles\nare assumed to be acute.

Note that if $b$ is between $a$ and $c$, then $b$ is relatively prime to $a$ and $c$, and $b$ cannot possibly divide $a^2c$. Therefore $b$ is either the least of the three consecutive integers or the greatest.Assume that $b$ is the least of the three consecutive integers. Then either $b|b+2$ or $b|(b+2)^2$, depending on if $a=b+2$ or $c=b+2$. If $b|b+2$, then $b$ is 1 or 2. $b$ couldn't be 1, for if it was then the triangle would be degenerate. If $b$ is 2, then $b(a^2+c^2-b^2)=42=a^2c$, but $a$ and $c$ must be 3 and 4 in some order, which means that this triangle doesn't exist. therefore $b$ cannot divide $b+2$, and so $b$ must divide $(b+2)^2$. If $b|(b+2)^2$ then $b|(b+2)^2-b^2-4b=4$, so $b$ is 1, 2, or 4. Clearly $b$ cannot be 1 or 2, so $b$ must be 4. Therefore $b(a^2+c^2-b^2)=180=a^2c$. This shows that $a=6$ and $c=5$, and the triangle has sides that measure 4, 5, and 6.Now assume that $b$ is the greatest of the three consecutive integers. Then either $b|b-2$ or $b|(b-2)^2$, depending on if $a=b-2$ or $c=b-2$. $b|b-2$ is absurd, so $b|(b-2)^2$, and $b|(b-2)^2-b^2+4b=4$. Therefore $b$ is 1, 2, or 4. However, all of these cases are either degenerate or have been previously ruled out, so $b$ cannot be the greatest of the three consecutive integers.\nThis shows that there is exactly one triangle with this property - and it has side lengths of 4, 5, and 6. $\\blacksquare$", "(Note: this proof is an expansion by pf02 of an outline of a solution\nposted here before.)In a given triangle $ABC$, let $A=2B$, $\\implies C=180-3B$, and $\\sin C=\\sin 3B$.\nThen$\\sin ^2 A = \\sin ^2 2B = 2 \\sin B \\cos B \\sin 2B = \\sin B(\\sin B + \\sin 3B) = \\sin B(\\sin B + \\sin C)$Hence,$a^2 = b(b + c)\\ (*)$Indeed, we know from the Law of Sines that$\\frac{\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{b} = \\frac{\\sin C}{c}$.Denote this ratio by $r$ ; we have $\\sin A = ra, \\sin B = rb, \\sin C = rc$.\nSubstitute in $\\sin ^2 A = \\sin B(\\sin B + \\sin C)$ and simplify by $r^2$.\nWe get $(*)$.At this point, notice that $(*)$ is equivalent to the equality\n$a^2c = b(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)$ from Solution 1. Indeed, the latter\ncan be rewritten as $a^2(c - b) = b(c + b)(c - b)$, and we know\nthat $c \\ne b$.

The six possibilities are:1: $\\ \\ a = b - 2, c = b - 1, b$2: $\\ \\ c = b - 2, a = b - 1, b$3: $\\ \\ a = b - 1, b, c = b + 1$4: $\\ \\ c = b - 1, b, a = b + 1$5: $\\ \\ b, a = b + 1, c = b + 2$6: $\\ \\ b, c = b + 1, a = b + 2$For each case, we could substitute $a, c$ in $(*)$, get an\nequation in $b$, solve it, and get all the possible solutions.\nAs a shortcut, notice that $(*)$ implies that $b|a^2$. If\n$a, b$ are consecutive integers, then they are relatively\nprime, so $b|a^2$ can not be true unless $b = 1$. In this\ncase the triangle would have sides $1, 2, 3$, which is\nimpossible. This eliminates cases 2, 3, 4 and 5.In case 1, $(*)$ becomes$(b - 2)^2 = b(b + b - 1)$, or $b^2 + 3b - 4 = 0$.This has solutions $1, -4$. The value $b = -4$ is impossible.\nThe value $b = 1$ yields $a = -1, c = 0$, which is impossible.In case 6, $(*)$ becomes$(b + 2)^2 = b(b + b + 1)$, or $b^2 - 3b - 4 = 0$.The solutions are $-1, 4$. The value $b = -1$ is impossible.\nThus, we get the unique triangle $a = 6, b = 4, c = 5$.", "NO TRIGONOMETRY!!!Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths of a triangle in which $\\angle C = 2\\angle B.$Extend $AC$ to $D$ such that $CD = BC = a.$ Then $\\angle CDB = \\frac{\\angle ACB}{2} = \\angle ABC$, so $ABC$ and $ADB$ are similar by AA Similarity.

So, if\n$\\pi/4 < \\alpha < \\pi/3$ then $\\pi/2 < 2\\alpha < 2\\pi/3$\nand $\\sin \\alpha < \\sqrt{3}/2 < \\sin 2\\alpha$.That means we will have to consider three possibilities:1: $\\ \\ \\frac{x}{\\sin \\alpha} = \\frac{x + 1}{\\sin 2\\alpha} = \\frac{x + 2}{\\sin (\\pi - 3\\alpha)}$2: $\\ \\ \\frac{x}{\\sin \\alpha} = \\frac{x + 1}{\\sin (\\pi - 3\\alpha)} = \\frac{x + 2}{\\sin 2\\alpha}$3: $\\ \\ \\frac{x}{\\sin (\\pi - 3\\alpha)} = \\frac{x + 1}{\\sin \\alpha} = \\frac{x + 2}{\\sin 2\\alpha}$Using the identities\n$\\sin (\\pi - \\theta) = \\sin \\theta, \\sin 2\\theta = 2\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta$\nand\n$\\sin 3\\theta = 3\\sin \\theta - 4\\sin^3 \\theta = \\sin \\theta\\ (4\\cos^2 \\theta - 1)$\nand simplifying by $\\sin \\alpha$ the three cases become1: $\\ \\ x = \\frac{x + 1}{2\\cos \\alpha} = \\frac{x + 2}{4\\cos^2 \\alpha - 1}$2: $\\ \\ x = \\frac{x + 1}{4\\cos^2 \\alpha - 1} = \\frac{x + 2}{2\\cos \\alpha}$3: $\\ \\ \\frac{x}{4\\cos^2 \\alpha - 1} = x + 1 = \\frac{x + 2}{2\\cos \\alpha}$Each case is a system of two equations in two unknowns, $x, \\cos \\alpha$.\nWe will solve each system, obtain all possible solutions, and chose those\nvalues for which $x, x + 1, x + 2$ and $\\alpha, 2\\alpha, \\pi - 3\\alpha$\ncan be the sides and angles of a triangle.Case 1: Compute $x$ from $x = \\frac{x + 1}{2\\cos \\alpha}$. We get\n$x = \\frac{1}{2\\cos \\alpha - 1}$. Substitute $x$ in\n$x = \\frac{x + 2}{4\\cos^2 \\alpha - 1}$. After doing all the computations\nwe get $4\\cos^2 \\alpha - 4\\cos \\alpha = 0$. The roots are $\\cos \\alpha = 0$\nand $\\cos \\alpha = 1$. None are acceptable if $\\alpha$ is an angle of a\ntriangle. So case 1 yields no solutions.Case 2: Compute $x$ from $x = \\frac{x + 2}{2\\cos \\alpha}$. We get\n$x = \\frac{2}{2\\cos \\alpha - 1}$. Substitute $x$ in\n$x = \\frac{x + 1}{4\\cos^2 \\alpha - 1}$. After doing all the computations\nwe get $8\\cos^2 \\alpha - 2\\cos \\alpha - 3 = 0$. The solutions are\n$\\cos \\alpha = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\cos \\alpha = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Only\n$\\cos \\alpha = \\frac{3}{4}$ is acceptable, and it yields\n$x = \\frac{2}{\\frac{6}{4} - 1} = 4$. Thus $4, 5, 6$ is a possible\nsolution to the problem.Case 3: Compute $x$ from $x + 1 = \\frac{x + 2}{2\\cos \\alpha}$. We get\n$x = \\frac{2 - 2\\cos \\alpha}{2\\cos \\alpha - 1}$. Substitute $x$ in\n$x + 1 = \\frac{x}{4\\cos^2 \\alpha - 1}$. After doing all the computations\nwe get $4\\cos^2 \\alpha + 2\\cos \\alpha - 3 = 0$. The roots are\n$\\cos \\alpha = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{4} \\approx 0.65, -1.15$.\nThe positive value is for an $\\alpha$ acceptable as an angle in\na triangle (it is a little over $\\pi/4$ ), and yields\n$x = \\frac{\\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}$. We can easily verify that\n$x, x + 1, x + 2$ can be the sides of a triangle.

The path $XYZTX$ becomes a collection of connected\nsegments $XY, YZ, ZT, TX'$ with the unconnected ends $X, X'$ on\nthe two line segments $AB, A'B'$.Specifically, we rotate the solid consisting of three faces around\n$BC$ so $\\triangle BCD$ is in the same plane as $\\triangle ABC$.\nThen we rotate the solid consisting of two faces around $CD$ so\nthat $\\triangle CDA'$ is in the same plane with the previous\ntriangles. (We denoted $A'$ the new \"copy\" of $A$, since the\noriginal $A$ is being used in the picture.) Finally, we rotate\n$\\triangle A'BD$ around $A'D$, so that it is in the same plane\nwith the other triangles. (We denote $B'$ the new \"copy\" of $B$,\nand $X'$ the new copy of $X$.)The polygonal path $XYZTX$ becomes $XYZTX'$. It is clear that in order\nto minimize $XYZTX$, we should make $XYZTX'$ be a segment on a straight\nline. Furthermore, to minimize the segment $XX'$, we want to choose\n$X \\in AB$ so that when we draw the line segment to its corresponding\nimage $X' \\in A'B'$, the length of $XX'$ is as short as possible.This was the \"folding out\" done in the solution above. To continue,\nwe will do a different \"folding out\", which will serve better for\nsolving the problem. Specifically, we rotate $\\triangle BCD$ around\n$BC$, then we rotate $\\triangle ABD$ around $AB$ to obtain\n$\\triangle ABD'$, and finally, we rotate $\\triangle AD'C$ around\n$AD'$ to obtain $\\triangle AD'C'$. Now $Z \\in CD$ becomes\n$Z' \\in C'D'$. The polygonal path becomes $ZYXTZ'$ going from\n$CD$ to $C'D'$. We need to make this as small as possible, to\nfind its minimum, if it exists.The idea of the solution to the problem is now easy to explain.\nFirst of all, $ZYXTZ'$ needs to be a segment on a straight line,\nin which case its length is the length of the segment $ZZ'$.\nClearly $ZYXTZ' = ZZ'$ has a lower bound (after all, it is $> 0$ ),\nso we can think about its lower limit. If there is a position of\n$Z$ in which this lower limit is achieved, then this lower limit\nis a minimum. Otherwise, there is no minimum value for $ZYXTZ'$.\n(Pay attention to the subtle distinction between lower bound,\nlower limit, and minimum.)In the picture above, $CD$ and $C'D'$ are not parallel. The segment\n$ZZ'$ would be shortest when $Z = D$ (and $Z' = D'$ ). But this is\nnot an acceptable position for $ZYXTZ'$, because the problem stated\nthat $Z$ is between $C$ and $D$, not equal to any of them. So in\nthis picture, there is no minimum for the polygonal path. (In this\ncase there is a lower limit for $ZZ'$, namely $DD'$, which is not a\nminimum.)On the other hand, if $CD \\parallel C'D'$ (see pictures below) then\ngenerally there are lots of points $Z \\in CD$ yielding a minimum\nvalue for $ZYXTZ'$. Indeed, in this case\n$CC' \\parallel ZZ' \\parallel DD'$, so the only requirement is for\nall the points $X, Y, Z, T$ to be inside the respective segments.\n(In this case, $ZZ' = CC' = DD'$ is a lower limit, and it is a\nminimum.)We will prove that $\\angle DAB + \\angle BCD = \\angle CDA + \\angle ABC$\nif and only if $CD \\parallel C'D'$. After this it will be easy to\ndeduce all the statements of the problem.Let $M, N, P$ be on $CA, BD', AC'$ be such that\n$CD \\parallel MB \\parallel AN \\parallel PD'$. The equality\n$\\angle DAB + \\angle BCD = \\angle CDA + \\angle ABC$ becomes\n$\\angle D'AB + \\angle BCD = \\angle C'D'A + \\angle ABC$, and then it\nbecomes $\\angle D'AN + \\angle NAB + \\angle BCD = \\angle C'D'P + \\angle PD'A + \\angle ABM + \\angle MBC$. Because of the\nparallelism of $CD, MB, AN, PD'$ we have several equal angles on the\ntwo sides of this equality. This equality becomes $\\angle C'D'P = 0$.So, the original equality $\\angle DAB + \\angle BCD = \\angle CDA + \\angle ABC$\nis true if and only if $\\angle C'D'P = 0$, which is true if and only if\n$CD \\parallel C'D'.$Now it is obvious that when\n$\\angle DAB + \\angle BCD \\neq \\angle CDA + \\angle ABC$ a lower limit\nexists (as expected), but it is not a minimum, and a minimum does not\nexist.On the other hand, when $\\angle DAB + \\angle BCD = \\angle CDA + \\angle ABC$,\nin the typical, general case, $ZZ' = DD'$ is the minimum, and there are\ninfinitely many segments $ZZ'$ of the same size (see Figure 2 below).There is one delicate point we need to worry about: we have to be sure\nthat $ZZ'$ intersects $CB, BA, AD'$. See Figure 3 for an example when\nthis does not happen; note that in this example we have some obtuse\nangles. Formally, $A$ has to be on the same side of $DD'$ as $C, C'$\nand $B$ has to be on the same side of $CC'$ as $D, D'$.Let us concentrate on the position of $A$ vs. $DD'$ (the statement\nabout $B$ is similar). We want $\\angle DAB + \\angle BAD' < \\pi$. We\nhave $\\angle DAB < \\angle CAD$ and\n$\\angle BAD' = \\text{the original } \\angle BAD \\text{ from the tetrahedron}$.\nSince both $\\angle CAD, \\angle BAD$ are acute, it follows that\n$\\angle DAB + \\angle BAD' < \\pi$.The last thing to do is to compute $ZZ'$. We have $ZZ' = CC'$, and\nfrom the isosceles triangle $\\triangle CAC'$ we have\n$CM = \\sin \\angle CAM$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $CC'$.

The first \"solution\" is based on a good idea, but it is so\nincomplete (it contains so mach hand-waiving) that it can not\nbe called a solution. Here are the issues with this \"solution\":a. The first problem (minor) is the statement \"On these three lines,\ntake three vertices $A_1, A_2, A_3$ respectively of an equilateral\ntriangle (it is well-known that this is possible...)\". This is *not*\nwell known, it should be proven.b. The second problem (a more serious one) is the statement that \"If\n$\\pi$ makes a small enough angle with the $\\pi_i$ 's, one of the\n$P_i$ 's we get this time must lie above $\\pi_4$ \". This is probably\ntrue, but not obvious at all, and it should have a proof.c. The third problem (this is so serious that it is a \"show stopper\")\nis the assumption (not stated explicitly) that the $z$ -coordinates\nof $P_1, P_2$ as functions of the angle $\\theta$ between $\\pi$ and\n$\\pi_i$ are continuous functions. This is not even true as stated,\nit depends on the choice of $A_1, A_2, A_3$.As I said, the idea is good, and this could be turned into a solution\nto the problem. I leave this task to the diligent reader.2. Below, I will give another solution to the problem. It is similar\nto solution 2, but different enough to warrant writing it down. Both\nthis solution, and solution 2, show that in fact, the tetrahedron\ndoes not have to be regular. The problem could be restated as\n\"Given four distinct parallel planes and a tetrahedron, prove that\nthere exists a tetrahedron similar to the given one with a vertex on\neach plane.\"", "As I remarked, this solution is similar with the previous one. Let\n$P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ be the four planes. We can assume they are\nhorizontal (in some $x, y, z$ coordinate system in which the $z$\naxis is vertical) and that their $z$ coordinates are in increasing\norder. Let $d_1$ be the distance between $P_1, P_2$, $d_2$ be the\ndistance between $P_2, P_3$, and $d_3$ be the distance between\n$P_3, P_4$.Now consider the tetrahedron $ABCD$. Take $C_1 \\in AD, A_1 \\in BC$\nand $C_2, A_2 \\in BD$ such that$\\frac{DC_1}{C_1A} = \\frac{d_3}{d_2} \\hspace{52pt} (1)$$\\frac{CA_1}{A_1B} = \\frac{d_2}{d_1} \\hspace{52pt} (2)$$\\frac{DC_2}{C_2B} = \\frac{d_3}{d_2 + d_1} \\hspace{30pt} (3)$$\\frac{DA_2}{A_2B} = \\frac{d_3 + d_2}{d_1} \\hspace{30pt} (4)$.Note that (3) and (4) imply$\\frac{DC_2}{C_2A_2} = \\frac{d_3}{d_2} \\hspace{52pt} (5)$$\\frac{C_2A_2}{A_2B} = \\frac{d_2}{d_1} \\hspace{52pt} (6)$.(1) and (5) imply that $C_1C_2 \\parallel AA_2$. Also,\n(2) and (6) imply that $CC_2 \\parallel A_1A_2$. From these\nit follows that the planes $(CC_1C_2)$ and $(AA_1A_2)$ are\nparallel.Now take two planes $P_B$ through $B$, and $P_D$ through $D$\nparallel to the parallel planes $(CC_1C_2)$ and $(AA_1A_2)$.\nIf we denote $e_1, e_2, e_3$ the distances between $P_B$\nand $(AA_aA_2)$, the plane $(AA_aA_2)$ and $(CC_1C_2)$, and\nfinally, $(CC_1C_2)$ and $P_D$, then (5) and (6) imply that$\\frac{d_1}{d_2} = \\frac{e_1}{e_2}$ and\n$\\frac{d_2}{d_3} = \\frac{e_2}{e_3} \\hspace{50pt} (7)$.From this it follows that we can find a similar transformation\nin the 3D space which takes our four planes into the four planes\n$P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. To make this explicit, we first take a\nrotation followed by a translation which takes $P_B$ into $P_1$.\nNow we take a scaling (with suitable origin and factor) which\nkeeps $P_1$ in place, and maps the image of $(AA_1A_2)$ obtained\nso far into $P_2$. Because of (7), the image of $(CC_1C_2)$ will\nmap into $P_3$ and the image of $P_D$ will map into $P_4$.Through these transformations, the image of the tetrahedron $ABCD$\nwill map into a similar tetrahedron with its vertices on\n$P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.[Solution by pf02, May 2025]"]}, "1972_usamo_problems/problem_2": {"id": {"year": 1972, "contest_name": "USAMO", "problem_number": 2}, "title": "1972 USAMO Problems/Problem 2", "problem": "A given tetrahedron $ABCD$ is isosceles, that is, $AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC$.

We have that triangles $ABC$ and $ABD$ are non-acute, so $C$ and $D$ are not strictly between planes $k$ and $l$. Therefore the length of $CD$ is at least the distance between the planes, which is $AB$. However, if $CD=AB$, then the four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are coplanar, and the volume of $ABCD$ would be zero. Therefore $CD>AB$.

This means that these two angles can never join to form side AD (because $\\angle BAC$ is more than the sum of $\\angle BAD$ and $\\angle CAD$ - a direct consequence of the facts that $\\angle BAC$ is obtuse and all three angles add up to 180 degrees), so the tetrahedron with obtuse triangle faces is impossible.", "Lemma: given triangle $ABC$ and the midpoint of $BC$, which we will call $M$, we can say that if $AM > \\frac{BC}{2}$, then $\\angle A < 90$.\nProof: Since $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $BM = MC = \\frac{BC}{2}$.

Below I will give another solution, inspired by rhombic\ndodecahedrons. Note that there are several non-equivalent\nrhombic dodecahedrons.

The segment\n$AB$ is parallel to the vector $v_B - v_A$. We have to show that we\ncan find two distinct points $C, D$, non-colinear with $A, B$ such\nthat $v_B - v_A = \\alpha (v_D - v_C)$ for some $\\alpha$, where\n$v_C, v_D$ are the vectors given by $C, D$.Before proceeding to do this, let us get a geometric feel for what\nour set $M$ looks like.The $x, y$ plane is the plane of the screen of your computer, and the\n$z$ axis is perpendicular to it, with the positive direction towards\nyou. The red points are the $6$ points\n$\\{(\\pm 2, 0, 0), (0, \\pm 2, 0), (0, 0, \\pm 2)\\}$\nand the blue points are the $8$ points $\\{(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1)\\}$.\nAll the faces are congruent rhombi.It is clear that each edge is parallel to several other edges. It\nis intuitively clear that each diagonal of a face is parallel to\na diagonal of another face. And it is intuitively clear that each\ninterior diagonal is parallel to another interior diagonal, or the\ndiagonal of a face, or an edge. But this is not a proof, so we\nwill proceed to give a formal proof.We will simply compute all the difference vectors, and show that\neach difference vector is a scalar multiple of at least one other\ndifference vector. We will do this in a table. We will label\nall difference vectors with (a), (b), (c),..., and use the same\nlabel when vectors are scalar multiples of each other.Below is the table. On the top row (the column headers) and in the\nleft column (the row headers) we list all the points in $M$. In the\ncells of the table we write the vector\n$\\overrightarrow{OB} - \\overrightarrow{OA}$, where $B$\nis in the top row, and $A$ is in the left-most column. We don't\ncompute the vector for $A = B$ (which would be $(0, 0, 0)$ ), or,\nif the index of $B$ is $\\le$ the index of $A$ in the list of points,\nwe don't compute the vector $\\overrightarrow{OB} - \\overrightarrow{OA}$.Now the proof is done. Indeed, all we have to do is examine the\ntable, and ascertain that each label is there at least twice, and\nit is attached to proportional vectors. The reader can easily do\nthis task.For the sake of making things explicit, and in order to understand\nthe geometry of this rhombic dodecahedron a little better, and to\nassist the diligent reader who would want to verify that each label\nappears twice and is attached to proportional vectors, I will give\na table showing information about the labels.[Solution by pf02, June 2025]Alternate solutions are always welcome.

We deal first with the special case where A'B' is parallel to AB. In this case let AA' and BB' meet at O. Then triangles OAB and OA'B' are similar, so O must represent the same point.

Perform the inversion with center $P$ and radius $\\overline{PO}.$ Lines $OA,OB$ go to the circles $(O_1),(O_2)$ passing through $P,O$ and the line $QR$ cuts $(O_1),(O_2)$ again at the inverses $Q',R'$ of $Q,R.$ Hence $\\frac{1}{PQ}+\\frac{1}{PR}=\\frac{PQ'+PR'}{PO^2}=\\frac{Q'R'}{PO^2}$ Thus, it suffices to find the line through $P$ that maximizes the length of the segment $\\overline{Q'R'}.$ If $M,N$ are the midpoints of $PQ',PR',$ i.e. the projections of $O_1,O_2$ onto $QR,$ then from the right trapezoid $O_1O_2NM,$ we deduce that $O_1O_2 \\ge MN = \\frac{_1}{^2}Q'R'.$ Consequently, $2 \\cdot O_1O_2$ is the greatest possible length of $Q'R',$ which obviously occurs when $O_1O_2NM$ is a rectangle.

We can construct copies of $T$ like this until we create a circle of radius $|T|$ and center $P_1$ that intersects segment $S$.

Both $BD$ and $DE$ have length $\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}$, from the Pythagorean Theorem.Proof of the original statement: Note that we can construct a triangle $B'C'D'$ congruent to triangle $BCD$ by applying Lemma 1 to segments $S_4$, $S_5$, and $S_6$. Similarly, we can construct $A_B$ and $A_C$ outside triangle $B'C'D'$ such that $A_BC'D'\\cong ACD$ and $A_CB'D'\\cong ABD$.Let $A'$ be a point outside of the plane containing $S_1$ through $S_6$ such that $A'B'C'D'\\cong ABCD$. Then the altitudes of triangles $A_BC'D'$ and $A'C'D'$ to segment $C'D'$ are congruent, as are the altitudes of triangles $A_CB'D'$ and $A'B'D'$ to segment $B'D'$. However, if we project the altitudes of $A'C'D'$ and $A'B'D'$ from $A'$ onto the plane, their intersection is the base of the altitude of tetrahedron $A'B'C'D'$ from $A'$. In addition, these altitude projections are collinear with the altitudes of triangles $A_BC'D'$ and $A_CB'D'$. Therefore, the altitudes of $A_BC'D'$ and $A_CB'D'$ from $A_B$ and $A_C$ intersect at the base $X'$ of the altitude of $A'B'C'D'$ from $A'$. In summary, we can construct $X'$ by constructing the perpendiculars from $A_B$ and $A_C$ to $C'D'$ and $B'D'$ respectively, and taking their intersection.Let $Y'$ be the intersection of $A_BX'$ with $C'D'$. Then the altitude length we seek to construct is, from the Pythagorean Theorem, $\\sqrt{|A_BY'|^2-|X'Y'|^2}$. We can directly apply Lemma 2 to segment $A_BY'X'$ to obtain this segment.

Thus, the derivative of $\\sin{\\theta} + \\cos{\\theta}$ is $\\cos{\\theta} - \\sin{\\theta}$, which is nonnegative between $0^{\\circ}$ and $45^{\\circ}$. Thus, we can conclude that this is an increasing function on this range.It must be true that $2\\sin{\\theta} \\leq 1$, so $\\theta \\leq 30^{\\circ}$.

(c) Can the task be done when $r=97$?", "answer_choices": "frq", "answer": "", "solutions": ["First we define the rectangular board in the cartesian plane with centers of the unit squares as integer coordinates and the following coordinates for the squares at the corners of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, as follows: $A=(1,1)$, $B=(20,1)$, $C=(20,12)$, $D=(1,12)$Let $(x_i,y_i)$ be the coordinates of the piece after move $i$ with $(x_0,y_0)=A=(1,1)$ the initial position of the piece.$1 \\le x_i \\le 20$, and also $1 \\le y_i \\le 12$.Let $\\Delta x_i = x_i-x_{i-1}$, $\\Delta y_i = y_i-y_{i-1}$Then, for any given $r$, we have $(\\Delta x_i)^2+(\\Delta y_i)^2=\\left( \\sqrt{r} \\right)^2=r$ for all $i$Part (a):In order to find out the conditions for which $r$ is divisible by 2 we are going to look at the following three cases:(1) When both $\\Delta x_i$ and $\\Delta y_i$ are divisible by $2$.(2) When both $\\Delta x_i$ and $\\Delta y_i$ are odd.(3) When one of $\\Delta x_i$ and $\\Delta y_i$ is even and the other one is odd.Case (1): Since $\\Delta x_i \\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $\\Delta y_i \\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$,then $(\\Delta x_i)^2+(\\Delta y_i)^2 \\equiv (0^2+0^2)\\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$.Thus, for $r\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$, this case is a valid one.Case (2): Since $\\Delta x_i \\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $\\Delta y_i \\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)$,then $(\\Delta x_i)^2+(\\Delta y_i)^2 \\equiv (1^2+1^2)\\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$.Thus, for $r\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$, this case is a valid one.Case (3): Since $\\Delta x_i \\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $\\Delta y_i \\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$, or $\\Delta x_i \\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $\\Delta y_i \\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)$,then $(\\Delta x_i)^2+(\\Delta y_i)^2 \\equiv (1^2+0^2)\\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)\\not\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$.Thus, for $r\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$, this case is NOT a valid one.Having proved that Case (1) and Case (2) are the only valid cases for $r\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$ we are going to see what happens for both cases when we start with a square where both coordinates are odd:if $(x_{i-1},y_{i-1}) \\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 2)$,then for case (1) : $(x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i,y_{i-1}+\\Delta y_i) \\equiv (1+0,1+0) \\;(mod \\; 2) \\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 2)$and for case (2) : $(x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i,y_{i-1}+\\Delta y_i) \\equiv (1+1,1+1) \\;(mod \\; 2) \\equiv (0,0) \\;(mod \\; 2)$and $(x_{i-1}+2\\Delta x_i,y_{i-1}+2\\Delta y_i) \\equiv (1+2,1+2) \\;(mod \\; 2) \\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 2)$This means that when $r$ is divisible by two, when starting at $(1,1)$ no matter how many moves you make all $(x_{i},y_{i})$ will either be $\\equiv (0,0) \\;(mod \\; 2)$ or $\\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 2)$.Since the ending coordinate is $(20,1) \\equiv (0,1) \\;(mod \\; 2) \\not\\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $\\not\\equiv (0,0) \\;(mod \\; 2)$, then the task cannot be done if $r$ is divisible by $2$.Now we look at the conditions for which $r$ is divisible by 3 by looking at the following three cases:(4) When both $\\Delta x_i$ and $\\Delta y_i$ are divisible by $3$.(5) When one of them is not divisible by $3$ and the other one is.(6) When neither $\\Delta x_i$ nor $\\Delta y_i$ is divisible by $3$.Case (4) : Since $\\Delta x_i \\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 3)$ and $\\Delta y_i \\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 3)$,then $(\\Delta x_i)^2+(\\Delta y_i)^2 \\equiv (0^2+0^2)\\;(mod \\; 3)\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 3)$.Thus, for $r\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 3)$, this case is a valid one.Case (5) : Since either $\\Delta x_i$ or $\\Delta y_i \\equiv \\pm 1\\;(mod \\; 3)$ and the other $\\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 3)$,then $(\\Delta x_i)^2+(\\Delta y_i)^2 \\equiv ((\\pm 1)^2+0^2)\\;(mod \\; 3)\\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 3)$.Thus, for $r\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 3)$, this case is NOT a valid one.Case (6) : Since $\\Delta x_i \\equiv \\pm 1\\;(mod \\; 3)$ and $\\Delta y_i \\equiv \\pm1 \\;(mod \\; 3)$,then $(\\Delta x_i)^2+(\\Delta y_i)^2 \\equiv ((\\pm 1)^2+(\\pm 1)^2)\\;(mod \\; 3)\\equiv 2\\;(mod \\; 3)\\not\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 3)$.Thus, for $r\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 3)$, this case is NOT a valid one.Having proved that Case (4) is the only valid case for $r\\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 3)$ we are going to see what happens when we start with a square that is $\\equiv (1,1)\\;(mod \\; 3)$if $(x_{i-1},y_{i-1}) \\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 3)$, then $(x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i,y_{i-1}+\\Delta y_i) \\equiv (1+0,1+0) \\;(mod \\; 3) \\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 3)$.Therefore starting at any $(x_{i-1},y_{i-1}) \\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 3)$ no matter how many moves the piece will always land at another square $\\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 3)$. Since we start at $(1,1)$, then the piece will always land at squares that are $\\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 3)$.Since final square is $(20,1) \\equiv (2,1) \\;(mod \\; 3) \\not\\equiv (1,1) \\;(mod \\; 3)$, then the task cannot be done if $r$ is divisible by $3$.In summary the task cannot be done if $r$ is divisible by $2$ or $r$ is divisible by $3$.Part (b):When $r=73$ we have $8^2+3^2=73$Therefore the moves can have the following values:\\[(\\Delta x_i, \\Delta y_i)=\\begin{cases} (\\pm 8,\\pm 3) \\\\ (\\pm 8,\\mp 3) \\\\ (\\pm 3,\\pm 8) \\\\ (\\pm 3,\\mp 8) \\end{cases}\\]Since we start at $(1,1)$ and we want to end at $(20,1)$ we can write the following $11$ valid moves:\\[\\begin{matrix} (1,1)&+&(3,8)&=&(4,9)\\\\ (4,9)&+&(8,-3)&=&(12,6)\\\\ (12,6)&+&(8,-3)&=&(20,3)\\\\ (20,3)&+&(-3,8)&=&(17,11)\\\\ (17,11)&+&(-8,-3)&=&(9,8)\\\\ (9,8)&+&(-8,-3)&=&(1,5)\\\\ (1,5)&+&(8,-3)&=&(9,2)\\\\ (9,2)&+&(3,8)&=&(12,10)\\\\ (12,10)&+&(-8,-3)&=&(4,7)\\\\ (4,7)&+&(8,-3)&=&(12,4)\\\\ (12,4)&+&(8,-3)&=&(20,1)\\\\ \\end{matrix}\\]Having shown that all moves comply with the possible values for $(\\Delta x_i, \\Delta y_i)$ and that all $(x_i, y_i)$ are inside the rectangular grid, then the task is possible when $r=73$.Part (c):When $r=97$ we have $9^2+4^2=97$Therefore the moves can have the following values:\\[(\\Delta x_i, \\Delta y_i)=\\begin{cases} (\\pm 9,\\pm 4) \\\\ (\\pm 9,\\mp 4) \\\\ (\\pm 4,\\pm 9) \\\\ (\\pm 4,\\mp 9) \\end{cases}\\]Let $S$ be a set of the squares of the rectangle with the condition $x_i \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\;(mod \\; 2)$ for $(x_i,y_i)$. That is, the reminder of $x_i$ when divided by 2 is the same as the reminder of $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil$ when divided by 2 where $\\left\\lceil k \\right\\rceil$ is the smallest integer that is not less than $k$. If that condition is true, then $(x_i,y_i) \\in S$Now let's look at a case (c1) where $(x_i,y_i) \\in S$ and $x_i \\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$, thus $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$ :c1 subcase 1 \u00a0: $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(x_i \\pm 9,y_i \\pm 4)$ :$(x_i \\pm 9) \\equiv (0 \\pm 9)\\;(mod \\; 2) \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$and $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i \\pm 4}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\pm 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv (0 \\pm 1) \\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$since $x_{i+1} \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_{i+1}}{4} \\right\\rceil \\;(mod \\; 2)$, then $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$ for this subcase.c1 subcase 2 \u00a0: $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(x_i \\pm 4,y_i \\pm 9)$ :This move is not allowed because the only values of $1 \\le y_i \\le 12$ such that $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$ are $5,6,7,8$. Adding or subtracting 9 from any of these numbers will either make $y_{i+1}<0$ or $y_{i+1}>12$ and will put the piece outside of the board.In summary, for case (c1), $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$Now let's look at a case (c2) where $(x_i,y_i) \\in S$ and $x_i \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$, thus $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$ :c2 subcase 1 \u00a0: $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(x_i \\pm 9,y_i \\pm 4)$ :$(x_i \\pm 9) \\equiv (1 \\pm 9)\\;(mod \\; 2) \\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$and $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i \\pm 4}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\pm 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv (1 \\pm 1) \\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$since $x_{i+1} \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_{i+1}}{4} \\right\\rceil \\;(mod \\; 2)$, then $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$ for this subcase.c2 subcase 2 \u00a0: $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(x_i \\pm 4,y_i \\pm 9)$ :$(x_i \\pm 4) \\equiv (1 \\pm 4)\\;(mod \\; 2) \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$Notice that the only values of $1 \\le y_i \\le 12$ such that $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$ are $1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12$. Adding 9 to the values of 1,2, or 3 or subtracting 9 from the values of 10, 11, or 12, will result in $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_{i+1}}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$. However, subtracting 9 from the values of 1,2, or 3, or adding 9 for the values of 10,11, or 12 will put the piece outside the board and not a valid move. Furthermore, for the values of 4 and 9, adding or subtracting 9 from them will result in the piece being outside of the board and not a valid move. Therefore for all valid moves in this subcase which are 9 added to 1, 2, or 3 or 9 subtracted from 10, 11, or 12, the result will be $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_{i+1}}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$since $x_{i+1} \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_{i+1}}{4} \\right\\rceil \\;(mod \\; 2)$, then $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$ for this subcase.In summary, for case (c2), $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$Therefore if $(x_{i},y_{i}) \\in S$ then $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$Now we look at the starting point: $(1,1)$ :Since $1 \\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $\\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)$, then $(1,1) \\in S$ and all subsequent squares after that $\\in S$Now let's look at the end point: $(20,1)$ :Since $20 \\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $\\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)$, then $20 \\not\\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{4} \\right\\rceil \\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $(20,1) \\not\\in S$Since $(20,1) \\not\\in S$, then there are no valid moves starting from $(1,1)$ that will end in $(20,1)$Therefore the task cannot be done when $r=97$.~Tomas Diaz. orders@tomasdiaz.com", "Slightly different than the first solution, we identify the board with the cartersian plane with the center of the squares integer coordinates such that $A=(0,0), B=(19,0),C=(19,11),D=(0,11)$.Part (a): If $2|r$ and $x,y$ are the change in the $x$ coordinate and $y$ coordinate respectively for a move, one finds $x^2+y^2 = r$ hence both $x,y$ are even or both $x,y$ are odd. Hence, since\nwe start at $(0,0)$, for any sequence of moves of distance $\\sqrt{r}$, the current position $(a,b)$ will always have the same parity between $a$ and $b$. On the other hand $B=(19,0)$ has a different parity between the first and second coordinate, so it is not possible to reach $B$ with $2|r$.If $3|r$, defining $x,y$ the same one similarly finds $x^2+y^2 = r$ hence $x^2 + y^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$. Considering the possible values of $x,y$ mod $3$, the only way this is possible is if both $x,y$ are divisible by $3$. Hence, since we start at $(0,0)$, for any sequence of moves of distance $\\sqrt{r}$, the current position $(a,b)$ will have both $(a,b)$ divisible by $3$. On the other hand $B=(19,0)$ doesn't have both coordinates divisible by $3$. So it is not possible to reach $B$ with $3|r$.Part (b): Note $8^2+3^2 = 73$. The following sequence of moves have $r = 73$ and show it is possible.\n\n\\begin{align*} &(3,8),(6,0),(9,8),(1,5),(9,2),(12,10),(15,2), \\\\ &(18,10),(10,7),(18,4),(10,1),(13,9),(16,1),(19,9), \\\\ &(11,6),(3,3),(6,11),(9,3),(12,11),(15,3),(7,0), \\\\ &(10,8),(13,0),(16,8),(19,0). \\end{align*}Part (c): Suppose by contradiction a sequence of moves reaches $(19,0)$ from $(0,0)$. Let $m_1, m_2$ be the number of moves where the second coordinate increased/decreased by a distance of $4$ respectively, and $n_1,n_2$ be the number of moves where the second coordinate increased/decreased by a distance of $9$ respectively. Apparently\n\n\\[4(m_1-m_2) + 9(n_1-n_2) = 0.\\]\n\nLet $m_1',m_2'$ be the number of moves where the first coordinate increased/decreased by a\ndistance of $9$ respectively, and $n_1',n_2'$ be the number of moves where the first coordinate increased/decreased by $4$ respectively. Apparently\n\n\\[9(m_1'-m_2') + 4(n_1'-n_2') = 19\\]\n\nIf $m_1-m_2 = n_1-n_2 =0$ then since $m_1'+m_2' = m_1+m_2 = 2m_1$ and $n_1'+n_2' = n_1+n_2 = 2n_1$ one finds $m_1'-m_2' = 2m_1'-2m_1$ and $n_1'-n_2' = 2n_1'- 2n_1$. In which case the above equation doesn't have an integer solution. Therefore $m_1-m_2$ and $n_1-n_2$ are not both zero.Now, the second coordinate must start at $0$ and end at $0$. If the sequence of moves simply adds values to the\nsecond coordinate and eventually subtracts those same values both $m_1-m_2$ and $n_1-n_2$\nwill be zero, contradicting the previous. (Or if it subtracts values and eventually adds those same values back).At each step we may add $4$, subtract $4$, or add $9$, or subtract $9$ to the second coordinate without leaving the game board. There are only two possible non-repeating sequences:\n\n\\[0,4,8\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[0,9,5,1,10,6,2,11,7,3\\]\n\nat which points there are no non-repeating moves possible since a $y$ coordinate value of $12$ is outside the game board. Thus in order to return to $0$ the sequence is forced to subtract the same values added (or add the same values subtracted), contradicting\nthe previous. So it is not possible to find a solution with $r = 97$.~not_detritiAlternate solutions are always welcome.

So for the cases where both are odd or both are even $f(m,n) \\le \\frac{1}{2} max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ with equality at $m=n=1$Now we need to find the case were one of them is odd and the other one is even.case $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd and $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even, means that $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1$ is evenTherefore $f\\left( max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)=0$$f(m,n)=f\\left( max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)+h(1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\})$,where $h(1,n)$ is the absolute value of the difference between the white area and black area of a triangle with base or size 1 and height n where this triangle is not necessarily a rectangular triangle.Therefore $h(1,n) \\le$ area of such triangle. Thus, $h(1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}) \\le \\frac{1}{2}min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$$f\\left( max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)+h(1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}) \\le 0 +\\frac{1}{2}min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$$f(m,n) \\le \\frac{1}{2}min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ when $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd and $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is evenWhich also means that$f(m,n) \\le \\frac{1}{2}max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ when $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd and $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is evenNow we look at the case where $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even and $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd, means that $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1$ is evenTherefore $f\\left( min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)=0$$f(m,n)=f\\left( min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)+h(1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\})$,Thus, $h(1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}) \\le \\frac{1}{2}max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$$f\\left( min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)+h(1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}) \\le 0 +\\frac{1}{2}max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$$f(m,n) \\le \\frac{1}{2}max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ when $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even and $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is oddTherefore, for all four cases: $m$ and $n$ are both odd; $m$ and $n$ are both even; $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd with $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even; and $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even with $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd we have:$f(m,n) \\le \\frac{1}{2}max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ with equality at $m=n=1$Part (c)Consider the case where $m=k$ and $n=k+1$ and k is even.$f(m,n)=f(k,k+1)=f(k,k)+h(k,1)=h(k,1)$We're going to calculate $h(k,1)$ noticing that the region for $h(k,1)$ in $f(m,n)$ will be the triangle formed by lines $y=kx$, $y=\\frac{k+1}{k}x$ and $x=k$.So, to calculate $h(k,1)$ we first calculate the total area of the black triangular regions within the triangle (assuming the first corner is white) with the following series formula:$S_{1}=\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{k+1}{k}j-j \\right)\\left(j- \\frac{k}{k+1}j \\right)=\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{k+1-k}{k} \\right)\\left( \\frac{k+1-k}{k+1} \\right)j^{2}$$S_{1}=\\frac{1}{2k(k+1)}\\sum_{j=1}^{k}j^{2}=\\frac{1}{2k(k+1)}\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}=\\frac{2k+1}{12}$Then, $S_{2}=\\frac{k}{2}-S_{1}=\\frac{k}{2}-\\frac{2k+1}{12}=\\frac{4k-1}{12}$$h(k,1)=|S_{2}-S_{1}|=\\left| \\frac{4k-1}{12}-\\frac{2k+1}{12} \\right|=\\frac{k-1}{6}$Thus for even $k$ we have $f(k,k+1)=h(k,1)=\\frac{k-1}{6}$Since for this case, $C=\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} f(k,k+1)=\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{k-1}{6}=\\infty$, then there is no upper bound for this case. Since part (c) describes an upper bound for all $m$ and $n$, then having found one case where there is no upper bound means that there is no upper bound when considering all $m$ and $n$Therefore, there is no constant $C$ such that $f(m,n)<C$ for all $m$ and $n$ because $C \\to \\infty\\;$ on some cases.~ Tomas Diaz. orders@tomasdiaz.comAlternate solutions are always welcome.

Thus, quadrilateral $A_{i+1}A_{i+2}A_{i+3}A_{i+4}$ is not tangential, proving the lemma.By lemma, the maximum number of quadrilaterals in a $n$ -gon occurs when the tangential quadrilaterals alternate, giving us $k = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$.Note that one can find the ratio of side of an equiangular $n$ -gon in order for alternating quadrilaterals to be tangential.[asy] import geometry; size(10cm); pair A, B, C, D, E, F; A = (0,0); B = (1,0); C = (1+(1-cos(2pi/9))*cos(2pi/9), (1-cos(2pi/9))*sin(2pi/9)); D = (-(1-cos(2pi/9))*cos(2pi/9), (1-cos(2pi/9))*sin(2pi/9)); E = midpoint(D--A); F = midpoint(A--B); draw(A--B--C--D--A); label(\"$A_i$\", D, NW); label(\"$A_{i+1}$\", A, SW); label(\"$A_{i+2}$\", B, SE); label(\"$A_{i+3}$\", C, NE); label(\"$x$\", E, W); label(\"$y$\", F, S); [/asy]Since exterior angles of a equiangular $n$ -gon have degree measure $\\frac{2pi}{n}$, one can write the equation:\\[2x = y + y + 2x \\cos \\frac{2pi}{n}\\]\n\n\n\\[y = x \\left( 1- \\cos \\frac{2pi}{n} \\right)\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{1}{1- \\cos \\frac{2pi}{n}}\\]Thus, we can find the ratio of sides of an equiangular $n$ -gon which fits the maximum to be $1\u00a0: 1- \\cos \\frac{2\\pi}{n}$.

Say $A_1, A_2, A_3$ were sequential points on a line. Considering the axis of symmetry between $A_2$ and $A_3$ one finds there lies a point $A_4$ on the right side of $A_3$. Then considering the axis of symmetry between $A_3$ and $A_4$ one finds sequential points $A_5$ and $A_6$ that lie on the right side of $A_4$. One can continue this process ad infinitum to show $S$ must have infinite points. A contradiction.Let a line roll/rotate around the perimeter of $S$ such that at any time all points of $S$ are on one side of the line and the line is always touching one point of $S$, but may touch two points of $S$ at a time. Say the line sequentially touches the points $S_1,S_2,...,S_n,S_1$. We will now prove $S_1,...,S_n$ form a regular polygon.Identify $S_0$ with $S_n$, $S_{n+1}$ with $S_1$, and $S_{n+2}$ with $S_2$.Considering the axis of symmetry between $S_2$ and $S_3$, a line which rolls counterclockwise around $S$ with starting position passing through $S_2$ and $S_3$ will roll symmetrically to a line which rolls clockwise around $S$ with starting position passing through $S_2$ and $S_3$. Let $l$ be the perpendicular bisector of $S_2S_3$. There are two possibilities: $S_1$ lies on the same side of $l$ as $S_2$ or $S_1$ lies on $l$. In the latter case apparently $S_4 = S_1$. In any event, $S_1$ has the property all points of $S$ are on one side of the line passing through $S_1$ and $S_2$, and this is not true for any other point on the same side of $l$ as $S_2$. A similar statement holds for $S_4$ and $S_3$. It follows $S_1$ must be symmetric to $S_4$ about $l$. So $\\angle S_1S_2S_3 = \\angle S_2S_3S_4$. Repeat for all other sequential $4$ points of $O$ to get\n\n\\[\\angle S_{k-1}S_kS_{k+1} = \\angle S_kS_{k+1}S_{k+2}\\]\n\nfor all $k$. Now, if $S_2$ didn't lie on the axis of symmetry between $S_1$ and $S_3$ there would exist another point $S_2'$ symmetric to $S_2$ about that axis, and as the line rolled around $S$ one would find it sequentially touched $S_1,S_2',S_2,S_3$ or $S_1,S_2,S_2',S_3$. A contradiction to show $S_1,...,S_n$ were defined. So $S_2$ lies on the axis of symmetry, thus $S_1S_2 = S_2S_3$. Repeat for all other sequential $3$ points of $S_1,...,S_n$ to get\n\n\\[S_{k-1}S_k = S_kS_{k+1}\\]\n\nfor all $k$. We have shown $S_1,...,S_n$ form a regular polygon.Now, the regular polygon $S_1...S_n$ has a well-defined center $O$ and there is certainly not another isometric polygon among $S$. Therefore any axis of symmetry about which we can reflect $S$ must reflect $O$ into itself. i.e. the axis of symmetry must intersect $O$.Let $A$ be a point of $S$. We will show $A$ is one of $S_1,...,S_n$. The axis of symmetry between $S_1$ and $A$ intersects $O$ by the previous. So $S_1OA$ is an isosceles triangle with $OS_1 = OA$. Therefore $A$ lies on the circle with center $O$ and radius $OS_1$. Note all points $S_1,...,S_n$ lie on this circle. If $A$ were not one of $S_1,...,S_n$, we could suppose $A$ lies between $S_k$ and $S_{k+1}$ on this circle, whereas all points of $S$ lie on one side of the line passing through $S_k$ and $S_{k+1}$. A contradiction. So $A$ is one of $S_1,...,S_n$. So $S$ is the regular polygon $S_1...S_n$.~not_detritiAlternate solutions are always welcome.

We will only substitute $\\sin(x)$ at the very end (along with the other trigonometric expressions) to keep calculations simple.Using the definition of a cosine, we have $XC = 8\\sqrt{3} \\cos(x)$. By the Law of Sines on $\\triangle BZC$, $\\tfrac{16}{\\frac12} = \\tfrac{ZC}{\\sin(x)}$, so $ZC = 32 \\sin(x)$. Thus $XZ = 8\\sqrt{3} \\cos(x) - 32 \\sin(x)$.We know that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $32\\sqrt{3}$ and that $XZ/AC = \\frac{8\\sqrt{3} \\cos(x) - 32 \\sin(x)}{8\\sqrt{3}}.$ Therefore,\n\n\\begin{align*} [XYZ] &= 32\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\frac{64 \\cdot 3 \\cos^2 (x) - 16 \\cdot 32\\sqrt{3} \\sin(x) \\cos(x) + 32^2 \\sin^2 (x)}{64 \\cdot 3} \\\\ &= \\sqrt{3} \\left( \\frac{96 \\cos^2 (x) - 256\\sqrt{3} \\sin(x) \\cos(x) + 32 \\cdot 16 \\sin^2 (x)}{3} \\right) \\\\ &= 16\\sqrt{3} \\left( \\frac{26 \\sin^2 (x) - 8\\sqrt{3} \\sin(2x) + 6}{3} \\right) \\\\ &= 16\\sqrt{3} \\left( \\frac{26(\\frac{19-4\\sqrt{19}}{38}) - 8\\sqrt{3} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{19}} + 6}{3} \\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\left( 13 - \\frac{52\\sqrt{19}}{19} - \\frac{24\\sqrt{19}}{19} + 6 \\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3} ( 19 - 4\\sqrt{19} ) \\\\ &= \\frac{304\\sqrt{3} - 64\\sqrt{57}}{3} \\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, $p+q+r+s+t = \\boxed{431}$.", "The original problem says that $X=\\ell_A\\cap\\ell_B, Y=\\ell_B\\cap\\ell_C$, and $Z=\\ell_C\\cap\\ell_A$.

It is sufficient to prove that $\\angle OFA = 90^{\\circ}$, as this would immediately prove that $A,P,O,F,N$ are concyclic.\nBy applying the Menelaus' Theorem in the Triangle $\\triangle BFC$ for the transversal $E,M,D$, we have (in magnitude)\n\n\\[\\frac{FE}{EC} \\cdot \\frac{CM}{MB} \\cdot \\frac{BD}{DF} = 1 \\iff \\frac{FE}{EC} = \\frac{DF}{BD}\\]\n\nHere, we used that $BM=MC$, as $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. Now, since $EC =EA$ and $BD=DA$, we have\n\n\\[\\frac{FE}{EA} = \\frac{DF}{DA} \\iff \\frac{DA}{AE} = \\frac{DF}{FE} \\iff AF \\text{ bisects exterior } \\angle EFD\\]\n\nNow, note that $OE$ bisects the exterior $\\angle FED$ and $OD$ bisects exterior $\\angle FDE$, making $O$ the $F$ -excentre of $\\triangle FED$. This implies that $OF$ bisects interior $\\angle EFD$, making $OF \\perp AF$, as was required.Let $A=1,B=b,C=c$ where $b,c$ all lie on the unit circle. Then $O$ is 0. As noted earlier, $(FOBC)$ is cyclic. We will find the ghost point $F',$ the second intersection of $OBC$ and $ANP$.We know that these two circles already intersect at $O$ so we can reflect over the line between their centers. The center of $ANPO$ is the midpoint of $AO$ namely $\\frac12$. With the tangent formula and then taking the midpoint, we find that the center of $OBC$ is $\\frac{bc}{b+c}.$ Then we want to find the reflection of 0 over the line through $\\frac12$ and $\\frac{bc}{b+c}.$ Then we get\\begin{align*} f' &= \\frac{\\left(\\frac{bc}{b+c}-\\overline{\\frac{bc}{b+c}}\\right)\\div2}{(1/2)-\\overline{\\frac{bc}{b+c}}}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\frac{bc-1}{2(b+c)}}{\\frac{b+c-2}{2(b+c)}}\\\\ &= \\frac{bc-1}{b+c-2}. \\end{align*}Now it remains to show $\\angle F'BA=\\angle ABM;$ the other angle equality would follow by symmetry.Then we get:\n\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{f'-b}{b-a}\\div\\frac{b-a}{a-m} &=\\frac{\\frac{bc-1}{b+c-2}-b}{b-1}\\div\\frac{b-1}{1-\\frac{b+c}2}\\\\ &=\\frac{\\frac{bc-1-b(b+c-2)}{b+c-2}(2-b+c)}{2(b-1)^2}\\\\ &=\\frac{b^2-2b+1}{2(b-1)^2}\\\\ &=\\frac12. \\end{align*}\n\nThus $\\measuredangle F'BA=\\measuredangle BAM,$ so $F'=F$ and we're done.~cocoheartsWithout loss of generality $AB < AC$. The intersection of $NE$ and $PD$ is $O$, the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$.Let $\\angle BAM = y$ and $\\angle CAM = z$. Note $D$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AB$, so $AD = BD$. So $\\angle FBC = \\angle B - \\angle ABD = B - y$. Similarly, $\\angle FCB = C - z$, so $\\angle BFC = 180 - (B + C) + (y + z) = 2A$. Notice that $\\angle BOC$ intercepts the minor arc $BC$ in the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$, which is double $\\angle A$. Hence $\\angle BFC = \\angle BOC$, so $BFOC$ is cyclic.Lemma. $\\triangle FEO$ is directly similar to $\\triangle NEM$Proof.\n\n\\[\\angle OFE = \\angle OFC = \\angle OBC = \\frac {1}{2}\\cdot (180 - 2A) = 90 - A\\]\n\nsince $F$, $E$, $C$ are collinear, $BFOC$ is cyclic, and $OB = OC$. Also\n\n\\[\\angle ENM = 90 - \\angle MNC = 90 - A\\]\n\nbecause $NE\\perp AC$, and $MNP$ is the medial triangle of $\\triangle ABC$ so $AB \\parallel MN$. Hence $\\angle OFE = \\angle ENM$.Notice that $\\angle AEN = 90 - z = \\angle CEN$ since $NE\\perp AC$. $\\angle FED = \\angle MEC = 2z$. Then\n\n\\[\\angle FEO = \\angle FED + \\angle AEN = \\angle CEM + \\angle CEN = \\angle NEM\\]\n\nHence $\\angle FEO = \\angle NEM$.Hence $\\triangle FEO$ is similar to $\\triangle NEM$ by AA similarity. It is easy to see that they are oriented such that they are directly similar.End LemmaBy the similarity in the Lemma, $FE: EO = NE: EM\\implies FE: EN = OE: EM$. $\\angle FEN = \\angle OEM$ so $\\triangle FEN\\sim\\triangle OEM$ by SAS similarity. Hence\n\n\\[\\angle EMO = \\angle ENF = \\angle ONF\\]\n\nUsing essentially the same angle chasing, we can show that $\\triangle PDM$ is directly similar to $\\triangle FDO$. It follows that $\\triangle PDF$ is directly similar to $\\triangle MDO$. So\n\n\\[\\angle EMO = \\angle DMO = \\angle DPF = \\angle OPF\\]\n\nHence $\\angle OPF = \\angle ONF$, so $FONP$ is cyclic. In other words, $F$ lies on the circumcircle of $\\triangle PON$. Note that $\\angle ONA = \\angle OPA = 90$, so $APON$ is cyclic. In other words, $A$ lies on the circumcircle of $\\triangle PON$. $A$, $P$, $N$, $O$, and $F$ all lie on the circumcircle of $\\triangle PON$. Hence $A$, $P$, $F$, and $N$ lie on a circle, as desired.This solution utilizes the phantom point method. Clearly, APON are cyclic because $\\angle OPA = \\angle ONA = 90$. Let the circumcircles of triangles $APN$ and $BOC$ intersect at $F'$ and $O$.Lemma. If $A,B,C$ are points on circle $\\omega$ with center $O$, and the tangents to $\\omega$ at $B,C$ intersect at $Q$, then $AP$ is the symmedian from $A$ to $BC$.Proof. This is fairly easy to prove (as H, O are isogonal conjugates, plus using SAS similarity), but the author lacks time to write it up fully, and will do so soon.End LemmaIt is easy to see $Q$ (the intersection of ray $OM$ and the circumcircle of $\\triangle BOC$ ) is colinear with $A$ and $F'$, and because line $OM$ is the diameter of that circle, $\\angle QBO = \\angle QCO = 90$, so $Q$ is the point $Q$ in the lemma; hence, we may apply the lemma. From here, it is simple angle-chasing to show that $F'$ satisfies the original construction for $F$, showing $F=F'$ ; we are done.By the Law of Sines, $\\frac {\\sin\\angle BAM}{\\sin\\angle CAM} = \\frac {\\sin B}{\\sin C} = \\frac bc = \\frac {b/AF}{c/AF} = \\frac {\\sin\\angle AFC\\cdot\\sin\\angle ABF}{\\sin\\angle ACF\\cdot\\sin\\angle AFB}$. Since $\\angle ABF = \\angle ABD = \\angle BAD = \\angle BAM$ and similarly $\\angle ACF = \\angle CAM$, we cancel to get $\\sin\\angle AFC = \\sin\\angle AFB$. Obviously, $\\angle AFB + \\angle AFC > 180^\\circ$ so $\\angle AFC = \\angle AFB$.Then $\\angle FAB + \\angle ABF = 180^\\circ - \\angle AFB = 180^\\circ - \\angle AFC = \\angle FAC + \\angle ACF$ and $\\angle ABF + \\angle ACF = \\angle A = \\angle FAB + \\angle FAC$. Subtracting these two equations, $\\angle FAB - \\angle FCA = \\angle FCA - \\angle FAB$ so $\\angle BAF = \\angle ACF$. Therefore, $\\triangle ABF\\sim\\triangle CAF$ (by AA similarity), so a spiral similarity centered at $F$ takes $B$ to $A$ and $A$ to $C$. Therefore, it takes the midpoint of $\\overline{BA}$ to the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$, or $P$ to $N$. So $\\angle APF = \\angle CNF = 180^\\circ - \\angle ANF$ and $APFN$ is cyclic.Construct $T$ on $AM$ such that $\\angle BCT = \\angle ACF$. Then $\\angle BCT = \\angle CAM$. Then $\\triangle AMC\\sim\\triangle CMT$, so $\\frac {AM}{CM} = \\frac {CM}{TM}$, or $\\frac {AM}{BM} = \\frac {BM}{TM}$. Then $\\triangle AMB\\sim\\triangle BMT$, so $\\angle CBT = \\angle BAM = \\angle FBA$. Then we have$\\angle CBT = \\angle ABF$ and $\\angle BCT = \\angle ACF$. So $T$ and $F$ are isogonally conjugate. Thus $\\angle BAF = \\angle CAM$. Then$\\angle AFB = 180 - \\angle ABF - \\angle BAF = 180 - \\angle BAM - \\angle CAM = 180 - \\angle BAC$.If $O$ is the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$ then $\\angle BFC = 2\\angle BAC = \\angle BOC$ so $BFOC$ is cyclic. Then $\\angle BFO = 180 - \\angle BOC = 180 - (90 - \\angle BAC) = 90 + \\angle BAC$.Then $\\angle AFO = 360 - \\angle AFB - \\angle BFO = 360 - (180 - \\angle BAC) - (90 + \\angle BAC) = 90$. Then $\\triangle AFO$ is a right triangle.Now by the homothety centered at $A$ with ratio $\\frac {1}{2}$, $B$ is taken to $P$ and $C$ is taken to $N$. Thus $O$ is taken to the circumcenter of $\\triangle APN$ and is the midpoint of $AO$, which is also the circumcenter of $\\triangle AFO$, so $A,P,N,F,O$ all lie on a circle.Median $AM$ of a triangle $ABC$ implies $\\frac {\\sin{BAM}}{\\sin{CAM}} = \\frac {\\sin{B}}{\\sin{C}}$.\nTrig ceva for $F$ shows that $AF$ is a symmedian.\nThen $FP$ is a median, use the lemma again to show that $AFP = C$, and similarly $AFN = B$, so you're done.Invert the figure about a circle centered at $A$, and let $X'$ denote the image of the point $X$ under this inversion. Find point $F_1'$ so that $AB'F_1'C'$ is a parallelogram and let $Z'$ denote the center of this parallelogram. Note that $\\triangle BAC\\sim\\triangle C'AB'$ and $\\triangle BAD\\sim\\triangle D'AB'$. Because $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $Z'$ is the midpoint of $B'C'$, we also have $\\triangle BAM\\sim\\triangle C'AZ'$. Thus\n\n\\[\\angle AF_1'B' = \\angle F_1'AC' = \\angle Z'AC' = \\angle MAB = \\angle DAB = \\angle DBA = \\angle AD'B'.\\]\n\nHence quadrilateral $AB'D'F_1'$ is cyclic and, by a similar argument, quadrilateral $AC'E'F_1'$ is also cyclic. Because the images under the inversion of lines $BDF$ and $CFE$ are circles that intersect in $A$ and $F'$, it follows that $F_1' = F'$.Next note that $B'$, $Z'$, and $C'$ are collinear and are the images of $P'$, $F'$, and $N'$, respectively, under a homothety centered at $A$ and with ratio $1/2$. It follows that $P'$, $F'$, and $N'$ are collinear, and then that the points $A$, $P$, $F$, and $N$ lie on a circle.Let $O$ be the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$. We prove that\n\n\\[\\angle APO = \\angle ANO = \\angle AFO = 90^\\circ.\\qquad\\qquad (1)\\]\n\nIt will then follow that $A, P, O, F, N$ lie on the circle with diameter $\\overline{AO}$. Indeed, the fact that the first two angles in $(1)$ are right is immediate because $\\overline{OP}$ and $\\overline{ON}$ are the perpendicular bisectors of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{AC}$, respectively. Thus we need only prove that $\\angle AFO = 90^\\circ$.We may assume, without loss of generality, that $AB > AC$. This leads to configurations similar to the ones shown above. The proof can be adapted to other configurations. Because $\\overline{PO}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AB}$, it follows that triangle $ADB$ is an isosceles triangle with $AD = BD$. Likewise, triangle $AEC$ is isosceles with $AE = CE$. Let $x = \\angle ABD = \\angle BAD$ and $y = \\angle CAE = \\angle ACE$, so $x + y = \\angle BAC$.Applying the Law of Sines to triangles $ABM$ and $ACM$ gives\n\n\\[\\frac{BM}{\\sin x} = \\frac{AB}{\\sin\\angle BMA}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{CM}{\\sin y} = \\frac{AC}{\\sin\\angle CMA}.\\]\n\nTaking the quotient of the two equations and noting that $\\sin\\angle BMA = \\sin\\angle CMA$, we find\n\n\\[\\frac{BM}{CM}\\frac{\\sin y}{\\sin x} = \\frac{AB}{AC}\\frac{\\sin\\angle CMA}{\\sin\\angle BMA} = \\frac{AB}{AC}.\\]\n\nBecause $BM = MC$, we have\n\n\\[\\frac{\\sin x}{\\sin y} = \\frac{AC}{AB}.\\qquad\\qquad (2)\\]\n\nApplying the Law of Sines to triangles $ABF$ and $ACF$, we find\n\n\\[\\frac{AF}{\\sin x} = \\frac{AB}{\\sin\\angle AFB}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{AF}{\\sin y} = \\frac{AC}{\\sin\\angle AFC}.\\]\n\nTaking the quotient of the two equations yields\n\n\\[\\frac{\\sin x}{\\sin y} = \\frac{AC}{AB}\\frac{\\sin\\angle AFB}{\\sin\\angle AFC},\\]\n\nso by $(2)$,\n\n\\[\\sin\\angle AFB = \\sin\\angle AFC.\\qquad\\qquad (3)\\]\n\nBecause $\\angle ADF$ is an exterior angle to triangle $ADB$, we have $\\angle EDF = 2x$. Similarly, $\\angle DEF = 2y$. Hence\n\n\\[\\angle EFD = 180^\\circ - 2x - 2y = 180^\\circ - 2\\angle BAC.\\]\n\nThus $\\angle BFC = 2\\angle BAC = \\angle BOC$, so $BOFC$ is cyclic. In addition,\n\n\\[\\angle AFB + \\angle AFC = 360^\\circ - 2\\angle BAC > 180^\\circ,\\]\n\nand hence, from $(3)$, $\\angle AFB = \\angle AFC = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAC$. Because $BOFC$ is cyclic and $\\triangle BOC$ is isosceles with vertex angle $\\angle BOC = 2\\angle BAC$, we have $\\angle OFB = \\angle OCB = 90^\\circ - \\angle BAC$. Therefore,\n\n\\[\\angle AFO = \\angle AFB - \\angle OFB = (180^\\circ - \\angle BAC) - (90^\\circ - \\angle BAC) = 90^\\circ.\\]\n\nThis completes the proof.First, let $O$ be the circumcenter of $\\triangle{ABC}$. Note that since $AP \\perp PO$ and $AN \\perp NO$, then $A$, $N$, $O$ and $P$, are concyclic.Notice that $NM \\parallel AB$ and $AB \\perp PO$, which means $NM \\perp PO$. It follows analogously that $PM \\perp NO$. This means that $M$ is the orthocenter of triangle ${NOP}$.Now consider what happens when we reflect line $AM$ over line $PO$. Since $PO$ is just the perpendicular bisector of $AB$, point $A$ will map to point $B$, and point $D$, which is both line $AM$ and $PO$, will map to itself. Therefore, we get line $BD$ from this reflection. It follows analogously that by reflecting line $AM$ over line $NO$, we get $CE$.Since line $AM$ passes through $M$, the orthocenter of triangle ${NOP}$, its reflections over sides $PO$ and $NO$, which correspond to $BD$ and $CE$ respectively, intersect on $\\odot{NOP}$ (this is the Anti-Steiner point application). Therefore, $F$, the intersection of $BD$ and $CE$, lies on $\\odot{NOP}$.Since $A$, $N$, $O$, and $P$ are concyclic, then $\\odot{NOP}$ is the same as $\\odot{ANP}$, so $F$ lies on $\\odot{ANP}$, which is the same as saying $A$, $N$, $F$, and $P$ are concyclic, as desired.First, we find the coordinates of $D$. As $D$ lies on $AM$, we know $D=(t:1:1)$ for some $T$. Now, we find\n\n\\[0=b^2(t-1)+(a^2-c^2) \\implies t=\\frac{c^2+b^2-a^2}{b^2}.\\]Thus we obtain\n\n\\[D = (2S_A:c^2:c^2).\\](Note we are using Conway's notation here). Similarly, $E = (2S_A:b^2:b^2)$, and it follows that\n\n\\[F=(2S_A:b^2:c^2).\\]The sum of the coordinates of $F$ is\n\n\\[(b^2+c^2-a^2)+b^2+c^2=2b^2+2c^2-a^2.\\]Hence, the reflection of $A$ over $F$ is simply\n\n\\[2F-A=(-a^2:2b^2:2c^2).\\]Then, it is obvious that $F$ lies on $(ABC):-a^2yz-b^2zx-c^2xy=0$.Alternate solutions are always welcome.

Now by Thales' theorem the angles $\\angle AXB = \\angle AYB = \\angle AZB$ are all right-angles.

Namely, the extensions of the segments\n$RS$ and $PQ$ meet at a point on the diameter $AB$ that is vertically\nbelow the point $Y$.Since $YR = AY \\sin(\\delta)$ and is inclined $\\alpha$ counterclockwise\nfrom the vertical, the point $S$ is $AY \\sin(\\delta) \\sin(\\alpha)$\nhorizontally to the right of $Y$.Now $AS = AY \\cos(\\delta)$, so $S$ is $AS \\sin(\\alpha) = AY \\cos(\\delta)\\sin(\\alpha)$ vertically above the diameter $AB$. Also,\nthe segment $SR$ is inclined $\\delta$ clockwise from the vertical,\nso if we extend it down from $S$ towards the diameter $AB$ it will\nmeet the diameter at a point which is\n$AY \\cos(\\delta)\\sin(\\alpha)\\tan(\\delta) = AY \\sin(\\delta)\\sin(\\alpha)$\nhorizontally to the left of $S$. This places the intersection point\nof $RS$ and $AB$ vertically below $Y$.Similarly, and by symmetry the intersection point of $PQ$ and $AB$\nis directly below $Y$ on $AB$, so the lines through $PQ$ and $RS$\nmeet at a point $T$ on the diameter that is vertically below $Y$.The Footnote's claim is more easily proved as follows.Note that because $\\angle{QPY}$ and $\\angle{YAB}$ are both complementary to $\\beta + \\gamma$, they must be equal. Now, let $PQ$ intersect diameter $AB$ at $T'$. Then $PYT'A$ is cyclic and so $\\angle{YT'A} = 180^\\circ - \\angle{APY} = 90^\\circ$. Hence $T'YSB$ is cyclic as well, and so we deduce that $\\angle{YST'} = \\angle{YBT'} = 90^\\circ - \\alpha - \\delta = \\angle{YSR}.$ Hence $S, R, T'$ are collinear and so $T = T'$. This proves the Footnote.The Footnote's claim can be proved even more easily as follows.Drop an altitude from $Y$ to $AB$ at point $T$. Notice that $P, Q, T$ are collinear because they form the Simson line of $\\triangle AXB$ from $Y$. Also notice that $P, Q, T$ are collinear because they form the Simson line of $\\triangle AZB$ from $Y$. Since $T$ is at the diameter $AB$, lines $PQ$ and $SR$ must intersect at the diameter.There is another, simpler solution using Simson lines.

In other words, we are trying to prove $\\angle {BDC} + \\angle {BAC} = 180$.\nLet the intersection of $BM$ and $AN$ be point $E$, and the intersection of $AM$ and $CN$ be point $F$.\nLet us assume $\\angle {BDC} + \\angle {BAC} = 180$. Note: This is circular reasoning. If $\\angle {BDC} + \\angle {BAC} = 180$, then $\\angle {BAC}$ should be equal to $\\angle {BDN}$ and $\\angle {CDM}$. We can quickly prove that the triangles $ABC$, $APB$, and $AQC$ are similar, so $\\angle {BAC} = \\angle {AQC} = \\angle {APB}$. We also see that $\\angle {AQC} = \\angle {BQN} = \\angle {APB} = \\angle {CPF}$. Also because angles $BEQ$ and $NED, MFD$ and $CFP$ are equal, the triangles $BEQ$ and $NED$, $MDF$ and $FCP$ must be two pairs of similar triangles. Therefore we must prove angles $CBM$ and $ANC, AMB$ and $BCN$ are equal.\nWe have angles $BQA = APC = NQC = BPM$. We also have $AQ = QN$, $AP = PM$. Because the triangles $ABP$ and $ACQ$ are similar, we have $\\dfrac {EC}{EN} = \\dfrac {BF}{FM}$, so triangles $BFM$ and $NEC$ are similar. So the angles $CBM$ and $ANC, BCN$ and $AMB$ are equal and we are done.Let $L$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Easy angle chasing gives $\\angle{AQP} = \\angle{APQ} = \\angle{BAC}$. Because $P$ is the midpoint of $AM$, the cotangent rule applied on triangle $MBA$ gives us\n\n\\[\\cot \\angle{MBC} - \\cot \\angle{ABC} = 2\\cot \\angle{BAC}.\\]\n\nHence, by the cotangent rule on $ABC$, we have\n\n\\[\\cot \\angle{BAL} = 2\\cot \\angle{BAC} + \\cot \\angle{ABC} = \\cot \\angle{MBC}.\\]\n\nBecause the period of cotangent is $180^\\circ$, but angles are less than $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle{BAL} = \\angle{MBC}.$Similarly, we have $\\angle{LAC} = \\angle{NCB}.$ Hence, if $BM$ and $CN$ intersect at $Z$, then $\\angle{BZC} = 180^\\circ - \\angle{BAC}$ by the Angle Sum in a Triangle Theorem. Hence, $BACZ$ is cyclic, which is equivalent to the desired result.-- Suli 23:27, 7 February 2015 (EST)Let $L$ be the midpoint of $BC$. By AA Similarity, triangles $BAP$ and $BCA$ are similar, so $\\dfrac{BA}{AP} = \\dfrac{BC}{CA}$ and $\\angle{BPA} = \\angle{BAC}$. Similarly, $\\angle{CQA} = \\angle{BAC}$, and so triangle $AQP$ is isosceles. Thus, $AQ = AP$, and so $\\dfrac{BA}{AQ} = \\dfrac{BC}{CA}$. Dividing both sides by 2, we have $\\dfrac{BA}{AN} = \\dfrac{BL}{AC}$, or\n\n\\[\\frac{BA}{BL} = \\frac{AN}{AC}.\\]\n\nBut we also have $\\angle{ABL} = \\angle{CAQ}$, so triangles $ABL$ and $NAC$ are similar by $SAS$ similarity. In particular, $\\angle{ANC} = \\angle{BAL}$. Similarly, $\\angle{BMA} = \\angle{CAL}$, so $\\angle{ANC} + \\angle{BMA} = \\angle{BAC}$. In addition, angle sum in triangle $AQP$ gives $\\angle{QAP} = 180^\\circ - 2\\angle{A}$. Therefore, if we let lines $BM$ and $CN$ intersect at $T$, by Angle Sum in quadrilateral $AMTN$ concave $\\angle{NTM} = 180^\\circ + \\angle{A}$, and so convex $\\angle{BTC} = 180^\\circ - \\angle{A}$, which is enough to prove that $BACT$ is cyclic.

Similarly, we can find $ABD_2C$ is harmonic. Therefore, $D_1=D_2,$ which means that $BM$ and $CN$ intersect on the circumcircle. $\\blacksquare$We use barycentric coordinates. Due to the equal angles, $AC$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $ABQ$ and $AB$ is tangent to the circumcircle of the $APC.$ Therefore, we can use power of a point to solve for side ratios.

Let $D$ be the midpoint of BC, $E$ be the midpoint of $AC$, and $F$ the midpoint of $AB$. By the similar triangles, we have $\\angle{BAD}=\\angle{AQE}=\\angle{AMC}$. We also have $\\angle{BAD}=\\angle{BPF}=\\angle{MNB}$, so we find $\\angle{AMC}=\\angle{MNB}$. We note that $\\angle{AMC}+\\angle{CMN}=\\angle{AMN}=\\angle{AQP}=\\angle{A}$, so $\\angle{CMN}+\\angle{MNB}=A$, which gives that $\\angle{BKC}=180-\\angle{A}$ and we are done.As an addition, $AK$ is the A-symmedian in $\\triangle{ABC}$.Let $w$ be the circumcircle of $\\triangle{ABC}$. Let $E$ and $F$ be the intersection of $w$ with $AQ$ and $AP$, respectively. By basic angle chasing, we have $\\angle{ABC} = \\angle{CBE}$ and $\\angle{ACB} = \\angle{BCF}$. So if the intersection of $BE$ and $CF$ is $D$, $BC$ bisects $AD$. And we know that $BC$ bisects $AN$ and $AM$, that means $N$, $D$ and $M$ are collinear. Now, we define the point $K$ which is the intersection of $BM$ and $w$. And let us say $X$ to the intersection of $CK$ and $AE$. By Pascal Theorem at $FCKBEA$ :$D$, $X$ and $M$ are collinear.
