Therefore, the probability of choosing a valid vertex B is $4/7$.There are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways to pick three vertices from eight total vertices; this is our denominator. In order to have three points inside the cube, they cannot be on the surface. Thus, we can use complementary probability.There are $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to choose three points from the vertices of a single face. Since there are six faces, $4 \\times 6 = 24$.Thus, the probability of what we don't want is $\\frac{24}{56} = \\frac{3}{7}$. Using complementary probability,\\[1- \\frac 37 = \\boxed{\\frac 47}\\]Since Solution 4 above describes the complementary case that doesn't fit the requirement, there'll be the direct way. Now we conduct meticulous classification for all the cases (Split the cases based on the relative positions of the three vertices.).Case $1$ Same plane : As described in Solution 4, the 3 vertices are in the same plane. There're 24 of them.Case $2$ Two of them are adjacent : We first pick two adjacent vertices. They have $12$ cases. Then the remaining vertex can only be located on the cubic opposite side of the two selected vertices, which has $2$ cases. So there're $12 \\cdot 2=24$ of them.Case $3$ None of them are adjacent : In this scenario, the three vertices will have one vertex surrounded. That very vertex might be any one of the 8 vertices on the cube, which leads to $8$ cases.As there're $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ overall cases and only cases 2 and 3 meet the enquirement, due to the classical probabilities, the probability is $\\frac{24+8}{56} = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$~Complemented by a mystery eastern egg (wtng)This problem is fairly simple. Start with $2$ points WLOG.Case $1$ : You pick 2 points that are diagonally across from each other but still on the same face. This happens with probability $\\frac {3}{7}$. We notice that $4$ out of the $6$ possible outcomes include a point inside the cube. Therefore, the probability of this happening is $\\frac {2}{7}$.Case $2$ : You pick 2 points that a directly across from each other. This happens with probability $\\frac {3}{7}$. We notice that $2$ out of the $6$ possible outcomes include a point inside the cube. Therefore, the probability of this happening is $\\frac {1}{7}$.Case $3$ : You pick 2 points that is a space diagonal of the cube. This happens with probability $\\frac {1}{7}$. Clearly, all of the points contain a point inside the cube, so our probability is $\\frac {1}{7}$.Adding these probabilities gives us $\\boxed {\\frac {4}{7}}$~Arcticturn"]}, "2009_amc_10b_problems/problem_23": {"id": {"year": 2009, "contest_name": "AMC 10B", "problem_number": 23}, "title": "2009 AMC 10B Problems/Problem 23", "problem": "Rachel and Robert run on a circular track.

Thus, there are $8$ cases.\nCase 3: 2 white squares.\nWe have $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to color two white squares without restrictions (the middle square must be black, giving us 8 squares to choose from).

However, we must consider the cases where at least two squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees.

Note that there are 8 ways in which we can arrange two squares differing by 180 degrees. Out of these, each one has two ways to put another square such that two differ by 90 degrees and 1 pair differs by 180.

Essentially the grid should look like this:1 2 34 5 67 8 9Next, consider the numbering of the grid after a $90$ degree clockwise rotation about the center. This is pretty easy to visualize. The grid should end up looking like:7 4 18 5 29 6 3I define an orbit to be a cycle of the squares affected by the previous square's color. For instance, a corner orbit would be 1 - 7 - 9 - 3 - 1 because after the rotation, square $7$ is getting affected by square $1$ 's position and we can reason for the others. Next, an edge orbit would be 2 - 4 - 8 - 6 - 2. We will first find the total number of colored orbits for a given corner orbit. The number of cases we will get for a corner orbit would be the same as the number of cases we will get for an edge orbit. We will multiply these cases together, and divide by the total number of configurations which is $2^{9} = 512$.\nA corner orbit is 1 - 7 - 9 - 3 - 1. If square $1$ was originally colored black, then square $7$ has absolutely no restriction at all because it's transformed position is exactly where square $1$ was, which was colored black. If square $7$ was left colored white, then we can easily see that square $9$ then must be colored black. Finally, square $3$ has absolutely no restrictions at all. Let's assume it was colored white originally. Then one possible corner orbit would be B - W - B - B - B. In fact, in any given orbit, if two entries in an orbit are colored white, then the orbit wouldn't exist. This means that say we color both $7$ and $9$ white in a corner orbit. Then, the orbit wouldn't exist because the new grid would all be covered black there would still be some white squares. Bearing this in mind and checking if our hypothesis stands true, we can quickly list down the rest of the corner orbit cases:B - W - B - B - BB - W - B - W - BB - B - W - B - BB - B - B - W - BB - B - B - B - BW - B - W - B - WW - B - B - B - BAs one can astutely notice, no \"W\" entries are sitting right next to each other! All of these orbits would actually work. Thus, we have a total of $7$ corner orbits. As we said before, because of the symmetry of a square, the edge orbits would function absolutely the same way as the corner orbits and thus we would also have $7$ edge orbits. To end with a full on black grid, we must combine a corner orbit with an edge orbit for a total of $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ cases. Thus the probability is $\\frac{49}{512}$ which results to $\\boxed{A}$.Note: The $5$ square in the middle just stays the same even after the rotation so that is why it isn't included in any of the orbits.~ilikemath247365"]}, "2012_amc_12b_problems/problem_16": {"id": {"year": 2012, "contest_name": "AMC 12B", "problem_number": 16}, "title": "2012 AMC 12B Problems/Problem 16", "problem": "Amy, Beth, and Jo listen to four different songs and discuss which ones they like.

There are 4 choices for which song is liked by Amy and Beth, 3 choices for which song is liked by Beth and Jo, and 2 choices for which song is liked by Jo and Amy. The fourth song can be liked by only one of the girls, or none of the girls, for a total of 4 choices. So $(a,b,c)=(1,1,1)$ in $4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot4 = 96$ ways.Case 2 : To find the number of ways for $(a,b,c) = (2,1,1)$ (without order), observe there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices of songs for the first pair of girls. There remain 2 choices of songs for the next pair (who only like one song). The last song is given to the last pair of girls. But observe that we can let any three pairs of the girls to like two songs, so we multiply by 3. In this case there are $(6\\cdot2)\\cdot3=36$ ways for the girls to like the songs.That gives a total of $96 + 36 = 132$ ways for the girls to like the songs, so the answer is $\\boxed{(\\textrm{\\textbf{B}})}$.Let $AB, BJ$, and $AJ$ denote a song that is liked by Amy and Beth (but not Jo), Beth and Jo (but not Amy), and Amy and Jo (but not Beth), respectively. Similarly, let $A, B, J,$ and $N$ denote a song that is liked by only Amy, only Beth, only Jo, and none of them, respectively. Since we know that there is at least $1\\: AB, BJ$, and $AJ$, they must be $3$ songs out of the $4$ that Amy, Beth, and Jo listened to. The fourth song can be of any type $N, A, B, J, AB, BJ$, and $AJ$ (there is no $ABJ$ because no song is liked by all three, as stated in the problem.) Therefore, we must find the number of ways to rearrange $AB, BJ, AJ$, and a song from the set $\\{N, A, B, J, AB, BJ, AJ\\}$.Case 1: Fourth song = $N, A, B, J$Note that in Case 1, all four of the choices for the fourth song are different from the first three songs.Number of ways to rearrange = $(4!)$ rearrangements for each choice $*\\: 4$ choices = $96$.Case 2: Fourth song = $AB, BJ, AJ$Note that in Case $2$, all three of the choices for the fourth song repeat somewhere in the first three songs.Number of ways to rearrange = $(4!/2!)$ rearrangements for each choice $*\\: 3$ choices = $36$.$96 + 36 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\: 132}$.There are $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose the three songs that are liked by the three pairs of girls.There are $3!$ ways to determine how the three songs are liked, or which song is liked by which pair of girls.In total, there are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3!$ possibilities for the first $3$ songs.There are $3$ cases for the 4th song, call it song D.Case $1$ : D is disliked by all $3$ girls $\\implies$ there is only $1$ possibility.Case $2$ : D is liked by exactly $1$ girl $\\implies$ there are $3$ possibility.Case $3$ : D is liked by exactly $2$ girls $\\implies$ there are $3$ pairs of girls to choose from. However, there's overlap when the other song liked by the same pair of girl is counted as the 4th song at some point, in which case D would be counted as one of the first $3$ songs liked by the same girls.Counting the overlaps, there are $3$ ways to choose the pair with overlaps and $4\\cdot3=12$ ways to choose what the other $2$ pairs like independently. In total, there are $3\\cdot12=36$ overlapped possibilities.Finally, there are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3!\\cdot(3+1+3)-36=132$ ways for the songs to be likely by the girls. $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)}}$~ NaferThis is a bipartite graph problem, with the girls as left vertices and songs as right vertices. An edge connecting left vertex and right vertex means that a girl likes a song.Condition 1: \"No song is liked by all three\", means that the degree of right vertices is at most 2.Condition 2: \"for each of the three pairs of the girls, there is at least one song liked by those two girls but disliked by the third\", means that for any pair of left vertices, there is at least a right vertex connecting to them.To meet condition 2, there are at least 3 right vertices with 2 edges connecting to left vertices. There are 2 cases:Case 1: there are only 3 such right vertices. There are $\\binom{4}{3}$ such vertices, with $3!$ ways of connections to the left vertices, total arrangements are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3! = 24$. The fourth right vertex either has no edge to the 3 left vertices, or 1 edge to 1 of the 3 left vertices. So there are $24\\cdot(1+3) = 96$ ways.Case 2: there are 4 such right vertices, 2 of them have edges to the same pair of left vertices. There are $\\binom{4}{2}$ such vertices, with $3!$ ways of connections. So there are $\\binom{4}{2}\\cdot3! = 36$ ways.Total ways are $96+36=132$.Another way is to overcount then subtract overlap ways. Similar to previous case 1, the fourth right vertex could have all possible connection to the left vertices except connecting to all 3, so it is $2^3-1=7$ ways, so the total ways are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3!\\cdot7 = 24\\cdot7 = 168$. But this overcounts the case 2 with 36 ways. So total ways are $168-36=132$.- juncheLet's assign to each of the 3 pairs a song that they like, and that song is disliked by the other girl(satisfy the problem's 2nd condition). The first pair has 4 choice, 2nd has 3 choice, and last one has 2 choice. $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2$. Then the last song can be liked/disliked freely, so there is $2^3 = 8$ total ways they can like/dislike the songs. Of these 8 cases, one of them is when they all like the song (which isn't allowed by the problem), so we subtract it away to have 7 cases. $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = 168$. But, we have overcounts when one pair of girls likes 2 songs, and the other girl dislikes those 2 songs. We can find the amount of cases that this happens by giving 1 pair of girls 2 songs that they like (and the other dislikes), and the other 2 pairs of girls 1 song that they like. There are 3 pairs of girls that we can choose to like 2 songs, so there are $3 \\cdot \\left(\\binom {4}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1\\right) = 36$ ways. $168 - 36 = \\boxed {\\textbf{(B) 132}}$.~heheman\n~Arcticturn (minor fixes in LaTeX)\n~EthanSpoon (minor fixes in LaTeX)"]}, "2013_amc_10a_problems/problem_24": {"id": {"year": 2013, "contest_name": "AMC 10A", "problem_number": 24}, "title": "2013 AMC 10A Problems/Problem 24", "problem": "Central High School is competing against Northern High School in a backgammon match.

Rerolling that one die is better than rerolling all three dice, since, as we have seen there is a $\\frac{5}{72}$ chance that Jason wins from that. Rerolling that one die is also better than rerolling two dice: by basic die probability, if Jason wishes for the sum of two rerolled dice to equal one value, the maximum probability this happens is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and this is when he wishes for the sum to be $7$ ; however, since he wishes for the sum of all three dice to be $7$, this will never happen, so the probability that rerolling two dice results in a win is always less than $\\frac{1}{6}$.Proof of only-if part : If the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least $7$, it would make no sense to reroll one die, since the final sum of all three dice will always be greater than $7$. Also, if the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least $7$, the total initial sum must also be greater than $7$, so Jason should not reroll zero dice.From having shown these two claims, we know that Jason should reroll two dice if at least one of them is a $1$, $2$ or $3$, and if the sum of any two of the initial dice is at least $7$. We can write out all the possibilities of initial rolls, account for their permutations, and add everything together to see that there are $42$ total outcomes, where Jason should reroll two dice.

Box A has chips $1$, $2$, and $3$, and Box B also has chips $1$, $2$, and $3$. Chip $1$ (from Box A)could be with 3 partners from Box B. This is also the same for chips $2$ and $3$ from Box A. $3+3+3=9$ total sums. Chip $1$ could be\nmultiplied with 2 other chips to make an even product, just like chip $3$. Chip $2$ can only multiply with 1 chip. $2+2+1=5$. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.Here is another way:Let's start by finding the denominator: Total choices.\nThere are $3$ chips we can choose from in the 1st box, and $3$ chips we can choose from in the 2nd box. We do $3*3$, and get $9$.\nNow - to find the numerator: Desired choices.\nTo get an even number, we need to pick 2 from at least one of the boxes. There are $2$ choices as to finding which box we will draw the 2 from. Then, we have $3$ choices from the other box to pick any of the other chips, $1, 2,$ and $3$.$\\frac{3 \\cdot2}{9} = \\frac{6}{9}$However, we are over counting the $(2,2)$ configuration twice, and so, we subtract that one configuration from our total.\n$\\frac{6}{9} - \\frac{1}{9}$.\nThus, our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.~ del-math.This might take longer to solve, but you definitely will have the right answer.\nYou first list out all the possible combinations regardless if the product is even or odd.\n$1 \\cdot 1 = 1.$ $1 \\cdot 2 = 2.$ $1 \\cdot 3 = 3.$ $2 \\cdot 1 = 2.$ $2 \\cdot 2 = 4.$ $2 \\cdot 3 = 6.$ $3 \\cdot 1 = 3.$ $3 \\cdot 2 = 6.$ $3 \\cdot 3 = 9.$\nThere are 9 possible combinations and $5$ of the combinations\u2019 products are even. So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.~MiracleMathsWe can use complementary counting to solve this problem. If we want to find the number of ways for the product to be odd, then the chip chosen from either box has to be $1$ or $3$. Since there are 2 ways out of 3 to pick an even chip from a box, the probability of picking an even chip from a box is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Since there are $2$ boxes, we can find that the answer is $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}$ =\n$\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.~JQTX941016"]}, "2017_amc_10b_problems/problem_17": {"id": {"year": 2017, "contest_name": "AMC 10B", "problem_number": 17}, "title": "2017 AMC 10B Problems/Problem 17", "problem": "Call a positive integer monotonous if it is a one-digit number or its digits, when read from left to right, form either a strictly increasing or a strictly decreasing sequence.

However, we cannot exclude every digit at once, so we subtract 1 to get $512-1=511$ monotonous numbers for this case.$\\bullet$ Case 2: Monotonous numbers with digits in descending order.This time, we arrange all 10 digits in decreasing order and repeat the process to find $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to include or exclude each digit. We cannot exclude every digit at once, and we cannot include only 0, so we subtract 2 to get $1024-2=1022$ monotonous numbers for this case.At this point, we have counted all of the single-digit monotonous numbers twice, so we must subtract 9 from our total.Thus our final answer is $511+1022-9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 1524}$.", "Unlike the first two solutions, we can do our casework based off of whether or not the number contains a $0$.If it does, then we know the $0$ must be the last digit in the number (and hence, the number has to be decreasing). Because $0$ is not positive, $0$ is not monotonous. So, we need to pick at least $1$ number in the set $[1, 9].$ After choosing our numbers, there will be just $1$ way to arrange them so that the overall number is monotonous.In total, each of the $9$ digits can either be in the monotonous number or not, yielding $2^9 = 512$ total solutions. However, we said earlier that $0$ cannot be by itself so we have to subtract out the case in which we picked none of the numbers $1-9$. So, this case gives us $511$.Onto the second case, if there are no $0$ s, then the number can either be arranged in ascending order or in descending order.

Note that we subtracted out the $1$ because we cannot choose none of the numbers.However, realize that if we pick just $1$ digit, then there is only $1$ arrangement. We cannot put a single digit in both ascending and descending order.

For any subset of all the digits $1$ to $9$ ( $0$ cannot be a digit for ascending order), we can always rearrange them into an ascending monotonous number. Therefore, the number of subsets of the integers $1$ to $9$ is equivalent to the number of ascending integers. So, $2^9=512$. However, the empty set ( $\\emptyset$ ) is not an integer, so we must subtract 1.
