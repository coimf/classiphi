(Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$, is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$, where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers. (Students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.)", "answer_choices": "frq", "answer": "119", "solutions": ["Let Mary's score, number correct, and number wrong be $s,c,w$ respectively. Then\n\n\\begin{align*} s&=30+4c-w \\\\ &=30+4(c-1)-(w-4) \\\\ &=30+4(c+1)-(w+4). \\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, Mary could not have left at least five blank; otherwise, one more correct and four more wrong would produce the same score. Similarly, Mary could not have answered at least four wrong (clearly Mary answered at least one right to have a score above $80$, or even $30$.)It follows that $c+w\\geq 26$ and $w\\leq 3$, so $c\\geq 23$ and $s=30+4c-w\\geq 30+4(23)-3=119$. So Mary scored at least $119$. To see that no result other than $23$ right/ $3$ wrong produces $119$, note that $s=119\\Rightarrow 4c-w=89$ so $w\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$. But if $w=3$, then $c=23$, which was the result given; otherwise $w\\geq 7$ and $c\\geq 24$, but this implies at least $31$ questions, a contradiction. This makes the minimum score $\\boxed{119}$.", "A less technical approach that still gets the job done:Pretend that the question is instead a game, where we are trying to get certain numbers by either adding $4$ or $5.$ The maximum number we can get is $70.$ The goal of the game is to find out what number we can achieve in only ONE method, while all other numbers above that can be achieved with TWO or MORE methods. (Note: This is actually the exact same problem as the original, just reworded differently and now we are adding the score. If this is already confusing, I suggest not looking further.)For example, the number $\"21\"$ can be achieved with only $1$ method $(4+4+4+4+5).$ However, $25$, which is a larger number than $21$, can be achieved with multiple methods (e.g. $5 \\cdot 5$ or $4 \\cdot 5 + 5$ ), hence $21$ is not the number we are trying to find.If we make a table of adding $4$ or adding $5$, we will see we get $4, 8, 12, 16, 20,$ etc. if we add only $4$ s and if we add $5$ to those numbers then we will get $9, 13, 17, 21, 25,$ etc. Now a key observation to getting this problem correct is that if we can add one of those previous base numbers to $20$, then there will be multiple methods (because $20 = 4 \\cdot 5 = 5 \\cdot 4$ ).Hence, the number we are looking for cannot be $20$ plus one of those base numbers. Instead, it must be $10$ plus that base number, because that results in the same last digit while maintaining only one method to solve. For example, if we start with $4$, the number $14$ would have only $1$ method to solve, but the number $24$ would have multiple (because $4 + 20 = 24$ and we are trying to avoid adding $20$ ). The largest number we see that is in our base numbers is $21.$ Hence, our maximum number is $21 + 10 = 31.$Note that if we have the number $25$, that can be solved via multiple methods, and if we keep repeating our cycle of base numbers, we are basically adding $20$ to a previous base number, which we don't want.And since the maximum number of this game is $31$, that is the number we subtract from the maximum score of $150$, so we get $150 - 31 = \\boxed{119}.$P.S. didn't think the solution would be this complicated when I first wrote it but it's quite complicated.

Hence we will restate the problem statement in this way:A group of $c$ children held a grape-eating contest. When the contest was over, the following was true: There was a $n$ such that for each $k$ between $1$ and $c$, inclusive, the child in $k$ -th place had eaten exactly $n+2-2k$ grapes. The total number of grapes eaten in the contest was $2009$. Find the smallest possible value of $n$.The total number of grapes eaten can be computed as the sum of the arithmetic progression with initial term $n$ (the number of grapes eaten by the child in $1$ -st place), difference $d=-2$, and number of terms $c$. We can easily compute that this sum is equal to $c(n-c+1)$.Hence we have the equation $2009=c(n-c+1)$, and we are looking for a solution $(n,c)$, where both $n$ and $c$ are positive integers, $n\\geq 2(c-1)$, and $n$ is minimized. (The condition $n\\geq 2(c-1)$ states that even the last child had to eat a non-negative number of grapes.)The prime factorization of $2009$ is $2009=7^2 \\cdot 41$. Hence there are $6$ ways how to factor $2009$ into two positive terms $c$ and $n-c+1$ :The smallest valid solution is therefore $c=41$, $n=\\boxed{089}$.If the first child ate $n=2m$ grapes, then the maximum number of grapes eaten by all the children together is $2m + (2m-2) + (2m-4) + \\cdots + 4 + 2 = m(m+1)$. Similarly, if the first child ate $2m-1$ grapes, the maximum total number of grapes eaten is $(2m-1)+(2m-3)+\\cdots+3+1 = m^2$.For $m=44$ the value $m(m+1)=44\\cdot 45 =1980$ is less than $2009$. Hence $n$ must be at least $2\\cdot 44+1=89$. For $n=89$, the maximum possible sum is $45^2=2025$. And we can easily see that $2009 = 2025 - 16 = 2025 - (1+3+5+7)$, hence $2009$ grapes can indeed be achieved for $n=89$ by dropping the last four children.Hence we found a solution with $n=89$ and $45-4=41$ kids, and we also showed that no smaller solution exists. Therefore the answer is $\\boxed{089}$.If the winner ate n grapes, then 2nd place ate $n+2-4=n-2$ grapes, 3rd place ate $n+2-6=n-4$ grapes, 4th place ate $n-6$ grapes, and so on. Our sum can be written as $n+(n-2)+(n-4)+(n-6)\\dots$. If there are x places, we can express this sum as $(x+1)n-x(x+1)$, as there are $(x+1)$ occurrences of n, and $(2+4+6+\\dots)$ is equal to $x(x+1)$. This can be factored as $(x+1)(n-x)=2009$. Our factor pairs are (1,2009), (7,287), and (41,49). To minimize n we take (41,49). If $x+1=41$, then $x=40$ and $n=40+49=\\boxed{089}$.

Obviously, none of the factors of $2$ in the denominator will cancel out, since the numerator is odd. Starting on the second term of the numerator, a factor of $3$ occurs every $3$ terms, and starting out on the third term of the denominator, a factor of $3$ appears also every $3$ terms. Thus, the factors of $3$ on the denominator will always cancel out. We can apply the same logic for every other odd factor, so once terms all cancel out, the denominator of the final expression will be in the form $1 \\cdot 2^a$. Since there will be no odd factors in the denominators, all the denominators will be in the form $2^a$ where $a$ is the number of factors of $2$ in $(2009 \\cdot 2)! = 4018!$.

This is simply the number of $1$ 's in the binary representation of $i$.Looking at the binary representations of some of the larger $i$ we see $2009 = 11111011001_2$ having eight $1$ 's.

All others are 6 or lower, because if there are more zeroes, to be divisible by 128 ( $2^7$ ), the last 7 digits must be divisible by 128, but 64 isn't.

Factoring out $2^6$ we see that$I_k = 2^6(2^{k-4}5^{k+2}+1)$Notice that for $k < 4$, $2^{k-4}$ will not be an integer, and will \"steal\" some $2$ 's from the $2^6$.

Now our exponent of $2$ is at $7$. But the divisibility rule for $4$ is the last $2$ digits of the number must be divisible by $4$. We know the last digits: $26$, which is not divisible by $4$. Therefore $5^6 + 1$ is divisible by $2$, but not $4$. Testing more values of $k$, we find that for $k \\ge 5$, the last digit becomes $1$, which means it is not even divisible by $2$.

For $k=5$, we see that $I_5=2^6(1+15625)=2^6(15626)$, which is divisible by $2^7$, because there is already a $2^6$ and the $15626$ only adds one more factor of $2$ (the last two digits of $15626$, $26$, are not divisible by $4$ ). For $k>5$ or $k\\geq6$, there are $(k-5)$ zeroes trailing behind $15625$, giving $I_k=2^6(1+156250...0)$. $156250...0$ is clearly even if there is at least one zero.

However, writing $2^{10}\\equiv 25 - 1\\pmod{125}$, we can easily verify that $2^{20}\\equiv -49\\pmod{125}$ and $2^{50}\\equiv -1\\pmod{125}$, giving us the needed contradiction.", "Notice that our sum of remainders looks like\n\n\\[S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 2^3 + 2^4 + \\cdots.\\]\n\nWe want to find the remainder of $S$ upon division by $1000.$ Since $1000$ decomposes into primes as $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$, we can check the remainders of $S$ modulo $2^3$ and modulo $5^3$ separately.Checking $S$ modulo $2^3$ is easy, so lets start by computing the remainder of $S$ upon division by $5^3.$ To do this, let's figure out when our sequence finally repeats.\nNotice that since the remainder when dividing any term of $S$ (after the third term) by $1000$ will be a multiple of $2^3$, when this summation finally repeats, the first term to repeat will be not be $1$ since $2^3 \\nmid 1.$ Instead, the first term to repeat will be $2^3$, and then the sequence will continue once again $2^4, 2^5, \\cdots.$Now, to compute $S$ modulo $125$, we want to find the least positive integer $d$ such that $2^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod {125}$ since then $d$ will just be the number of terms of $S$ (after the third term!) before the sequence repeats. In other words, our sequence will be of the form $S = 1 + 2 + 4 + \\left(2^3 + 2^4 + \\cdots + 2^{2 + d}\\right)$ and then we will have $2^{d + 3} \\equiv 2^3 \\pmod {125}$, and the sequence will repeat from there. Here, $d$ simply represents the order of $2$ modulo $125$, denoted by $d = \\text{ord}_{125}(2).$ To begin with, we'll use a well-known property of the order to get a bound on $d.$Since $\\gcd(2, 125) = 1$ and $\\phi(125) = 100$, we know by Euler's Theorem that $2^{100} \\equiv 1 \\pmod {125}.$ However, we do not know that $100$ is the least $d$ satisfying $2^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod {125}.$ Nonetheless, it is a well known property of the order that $\\text{ord}_{125}(2) = d | \\phi(125) = 100.$ Therefore, we can conclude that $d$ must be a positive divisor of $100.$Now, this still leaves a lot of possibilities, so let's consider a smaller modulus for the moment, say $\\mod 5.$ Clearly, we must have that $2^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5.$ Since $2^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$ and powers of two will then cycle every four terms, we know that $2^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5 \\iff 4 | d.$ Combining this relation with $d | 100$, it follows that $d \\in \\{4, 20, 100\\}.$Now, it is trivial to verify that $d \\ne 4.$ In addition, we know that\n\n\\[2^{20} = \\left(2^{10}\\right)^2 = \\left(1024\\right)^2 \\equiv 24^2 = 576 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod {125}.\\]\n\nTherefore, we conclude that $d \\ne 20.$ Hence, we must have $d = 100.$ (Notice that we could have guessed this by Euler's, but we couldn't have been certain without investigating the order more thoroughly).Now, since we have found $d = 100$, we know that\n\n\\[S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 2^3 + 2^4 + \\cdots + 2^{102}.\\]\n\nThere are two good ways to finish from here:The first way is to use a trick involving powers of $2.$ Notice that\n\n\\[S = 1 + 2 + 4 +... + 2^{102} = 2^{103} - 1.\\]\n\nCertainly\n\n\\[S = 2^{103} - 1 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod {8}.\\]\n\nIn addition, since we already computed $\\text{ord}_{125}(2) = d = 100$, we know that\n\n\\[S = 2^{103} - 1 = 2^{100} \\cdot 2^3 - 1 \\equiv 2^3 - 1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod {125}.\\]\n\nTherefore, since $S \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$ and $S \\equiv 7 \\pmod{125}$, we conclude that $S \\equiv \\boxed{007} \\pmod {1000}.$The second way is not as slick, but works better in a general setting when there aren't any convenient tricks as in Method 1. Let us split the terms of $S$ into groups:\n\n\\[R = 1 + 2 + 4; \\quad T = 2^3 + 2^4 + \\cdots + 2^{102}.\\]\n\nIt is easy to see that $R$ is congruent to $7$ modulo $1000.$Now, for $T$, notice that there are $100$ terms in the summation, each with a different remainder upon division by $125.$ Since each of these remainders is certainly relatively prime to $125$, these $100$ remainders correspond to the $100$ positive integers less than $125$ that are relatively prime to $125.$ Therefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}T &\\equiv 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 11 + \\cdots + 124 \\pmod{125} \\\\ &= \\left(1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 125\\right) - \\left(5 + 10 + 15 + \\cdots 125\\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{125 \\cdot 126}{2} - 5\\left(1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots 25\\right) \\\\ &= 125 \\cdot 63 - 5\\left(\\frac{25 \\cdot 26}{2}\\right) \\\\ &= 125\\left(63 - 13\\right) \\\\ &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}.\\end{align*}\n\nThen, since $T$ is divisible by $125$ and $8$, it follows that $T$ is divisible by $1000.$ Therefore,\n\n\\[S = R + T \\equiv R \\equiv \\boxed{007} \\pmod{1000}.\\]", "Obviously, $2^i$ will have to repeat at some point, and our goal is just to find when it repeats.

Obviously, if it is 0 mod 1000, this means directly that it is 0 mod 8 and 0 mod 125. Since $2^{a-b} - 1$ has to be odd, this necessarily means $b \\ge 3$ for $8 \\div 2^b.$ This means that 125 has to divide $2^{a-b} - 1.$ We wish to find the minimum $a - b$ such that this is true, or similarly, we just wish to find $\\text{ord}_{125}(2).$ Note that by Euler's Totient Theorem, that $2^{100} \\equiv 1 \\mod 125.$ After checking, and seeing that $2^{50} \\equiv -1 \\mod 125$, this directly means that $\\text{ord}_{125}(2) = 100$ or $a - b = 100.$ Since $b \\ge 3$, the smallest $(a, b)$ pair is\n$(103, 3).$ What this really means is that the sequence of remainders will start repeating at $2^{103}$ or namely that\n$\\{2^0, 2^1,..., 2^{102}\\}$ are all distinct residues mod 1000. Adding these yields\n\n\\[2^{103} - 1 \\equiv 8 - 1 \\equiv \\boxed{7} \\mod 1000\\]", "If we write out the remainders when powers of $2$ are divided by $1000$, we must eventually write a number we have already written down. After this happens, we will fall into a cycle, and thus, nothing new will be written down.The answer extraction of the problem is equivalent to asking for $1+2+4 + \\dots + 2^n \\pmod{1000}$, where $2^{n+1}$ is the first number whose remainder when divided by $1000$ is a repeat. This expression is equivalent to $2^{n+1}-1 \\pmod{1000}$. So our answer will just be the first repeated remainder minus $1$.(Everything up to this point has been perfectly rigorous; now, we will destroy this.)Note that $1$, $2$ and $4$ cannot be the first repeated remainders, due to the $2$, $4$ and $8$ divisibility rules, respectively (i.e. $2^0$, $2^1$ and $2^2$ are the only powers of $2$ that leave a remainder of $1$, $2$ and $4$, respectively, when divided by $1000$.) There is no reason why $8$ could not be the first repeated remainder, so it probably is. Thus, our answer is $8-1 = \\boxed{7}$.

If we consider it modulo $25$, we see that we get every residue except for $0,5,10,15,20$ (ie. all multiples of $5$ ). This is similar to hensel's lemma but it isn't and from here we assume the pattern will continue in that the residues will only be exempt of the multiples of $5$ in modulo $125$.

Notice that whenever the value of $(1/2)x_f$ changes, the value of $(1/8)x_f$ must change. This means that every case in $k=2$ is covered by $k=8$. This is extended to every number that is a factor of another (3 and 9, 5 and 10). Therefore, we can eliminate $k=2,3,4,5$ as they are all factors of other values of $k$, which eliminates 10 cases.Within the remaining numbers, there are a couple of numbers that can still have repeating values.

Therefore, from this, we see that the smallest $m$ such that $n|\\underbrace{999\\cdots999}_{m \\text{ nines}}$ is $m = 6.$ Also, the smallest number $m$ such that $(n+6)|\\underbrace{999\\cdots999}_{m \\text{ nines}}$ is $m = 4$ by similar reasoning.Proceeding, we can factorize $9999 = 99 \\times 101,$ after which we see that $n+6$ must contain a prime factor of $101$ as it cannot divide $99$ but must divide $9999.$ However, $101$ is prime, so $101|(n+6)$! Looking at the answer choices, all of the intervals are less than $1000,$ so we know that (the minimum value of) $n+6$ is thereby either $101, 101 \\times 3,$ or $101 \\times 9.$ Testing, we see that $n+6 = 303$ gives $n = 297 = 3^3 \\times 11,$ which in fact is a divisor of $999 \\times 1001$ while not being a divisor of $999.$ Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}}.$~ Professor-Mom"]}, "2016_umo_problems/problem_5": {"id": {"year": 2016, "contest_name": "UMO", "problem_number": 5}, "title": "2016 UMO Problems/Problem 5", "problem": "Let $a_0,a_1,a_2,\\ldots$ be a sequence of integers (positive, negative, or zero) such that for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $k$, $a_{n+k}^2-(2k + 1)a_{n}a_{n+k} + (k^2 + k)a_n^2 = k^2-k$.

First, note that if the prime $p$ is a divisor of $2019$, then $2019^8$ is a multiple of $p$ and $2019^8+1$ is not.

By Fermat's Little Theorem, $2019^{p-1}\\equiv1\\pmod{p}$, and plugging in values, we get $2019^{16k+n}\\equiv1\\pmod{p}$, where $n=m-1$ and is thus an even integer ranging from $2$ to $14$, inclusive.If $n=8$, then $2019^{16k+8}\\equiv1\\pmod{p}$, which creates a contradiction. If $n$ is not a multiple of $8$ but is a multiple of $4$, squaring both sides of $2019^{16k+n}\\equiv1\\pmod{p}$ also results in the same contradictory equivalence.

Up to here, we used the exponent and addition log identities.Now before we move on to the next few simplification steps, we must remember that $gcd(a,b)$ * $lcm(a,b)$ = $a*b$.We've now gotten to the crucial part of this equation. Though this wouldn't pass for full points in a proof-based contest, this is AIME. So, we assume that $x<y$. We also let $x$ = $10^a$ and $y$ = $10^b$ That means that $gcd(x,y)$ is $x$ and the $lcm(x,y)$ is $y$ due to the fact that we are also assuming that both $x,y$ are $10^a$, $10^b$ respectively.If we put our last few insights together into the first and second equation, we see that $x$ = $10^{20}$. We also see that $y$ = $10^{190}$. We could check these if wanted (don't worry they work), but if you were very limited on time for this question, just assume these values work and move on.Now $10^{20}$ factors as $2^{20}$ * $5^{20}$. This has $40$ prime factors. $2$, $20$ times and $5$, $20$ times. $10^{190}$ factors as $2^{190}$ * $5^{190}$. This has $380$ prime factors. $2$, $190$ times and $5$, $190$ times.

Either it will increase by 1, or it will \"wrap around', going from $5\\rightarrow 0$ (mod 6) and in general, $(n-1) \\rightarrow 0$ (mod n). We will use ' $+1$ ' to refer to remainders that increase by 1, and 'wrap-around's to refer to remainders that go to 0.Clearly, $9$ $+1$ s isn't possible, since then $R(n)\\ne R(n+1)$.If there are $8$ $+1$ s and $1$ wrap-around, the wrap-around must be equal to $-8$, which is the case for mod $(9)$. However, if $n$ is $8$ mod $9$, it clearly must also be $2$ mod $3$, meaning mod (3) must also be a wrap-around, and this case won't work.If there are $7$ $+1$ s and $2$ wrap-arounds, these two wrap-arounds must add to $-7$. For the possible modulo, we could have $(2,7)$, $(3,6)$, and $(4,5)$. Clearly, $(3,6)$ won't work since if it is $5$ mod $6$, then it must also be $1$ mod $2$, meaning $(3,6)$ won't be the only wrap-arounds. Similarly, $(4,5)$ doesn't work since $3$ mod $4$ implies that $1$ mod $2$ will also be a wrap-around. That leaves $(2,7)$. The number must be $1$ mod $2$ and $6$ mod $7$, or in other words, $-1$ mod $2$ and $-1$ mod $7$, meaning n will be $-1 \\equiv 13$ mod $14$. Testing all such two digits numbers that are equivalent to $13$ mod $14$, we see that $13$ and $97$ are the only two that work.If there are $6$ $+1$ s and $3$ wrap-arounds, the only possible combination of modulo is $(2,3,4)$. Thus, $n$ must be $11$ mod $12$. However, this means that mod $6$ will also be a wrap around, so this case won't work.Notice that there can be no more cases, as for $5$ $+1$ s, no matter what mods wrap around, the $+1$ s will not be able to balance them out, as it's magnitude is too small.

Multiplying this equation by 4, we get\n\n\n\\[ \\left( 2 c + b \\right)^2 + 3 b^2 = 438^2. \\hspace{1cm} (1) \\] Denote $d = 2 c + b$. Because $c \\leq b$, $b < d \\leq 3 b$. Because $438^2 - 3 b^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, $d^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\nThus, $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\nThis implies $d^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. We also have $438^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$.\nHence, $3 b^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$.\nThis implies $b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Denote $b = 3 p$ and $d = 3 q$. Hence, $p < q \\leq 3 p$.\nHence, Equation (1) can be written as\n\n\n\\[ q^2 + 3 p^2 = 146^2. \\hspace{1cm} (2) \\] Now, we solve this equation. First, we find an upper bound of $q$. We have $q^2 + 3 p^2 \\geq q^2 + 3 \\left( \\frac{q}{3} \\right)^2 = \\frac{4 q^2}{3}$.\nHence, $\\frac{4 q^2}{3} \\leq 146^2$.\nHence, $q \\leq 73 \\sqrt{3} < 73 \\cdot 1.8 = 131.4$.\nBecause $q$ is an integer, we must have $q \\leq 131$. Second, we find a lower bound of $q$. We have $q^2 + 3 p^2 < q^2 + 3 q^2 = 4 q^2$.\nHence, $4 q^2 > 146^2$.\nHence, $q > 73$.\nBecause $q$ is an integer, we must have $q \\geq 74$. Now, we find the integer solutions of $p$ and $q$ that satisfy Equation (2) with $74 \\leq q \\leq 131$. First, modulo 9,\n\n\n\\begin{align*} q^2 & \\equiv 146^2 - 3 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 4 - 3 \\cdot ( 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 ) \\\\ & \\equiv 4 \\mbox{ or } 1. \\end{align*} Hence $q \\equiv \\pm 1, \\pm 2 \\pmod{9}$. Second, modulo 5,\n\n\n\\begin{align*} q^2 & \\equiv 146^2 - 3 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 1 + 2 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 1 + 2 \\cdot ( 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } -1 ) \\\\ & \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } 3 \\mbox{ or } - 1. \\end{align*} Because $q^2 \\equiv 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } - 1$, we must have $q^2 \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } - 1$.\nHence, $5 \\nmid q$. Third, modulo 7,\n\n\n\\begin{align*} q^2 & \\equiv 146^2 - 3 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 1 - 3 \\cdot ( 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } 5 \\mbox{ or } 2 ) \\\\ & \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } 2 \\mbox{ or } 3 \\mbox{ or } 5. \\end{align*} Because $q^2 \\equiv 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } 2 \\mbox{ or } 4 \\pmod{ 7 }$, we must have $q^2 \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } 2 \\pmod{7}$.\nHence, $q \\equiv 1, 3, 4, 6 \\pmod{7}$. Given all conditions above, the possible $q$ are 74, 83, 88, 92, 97, 101, 106, 109, 116, 118, 127. By testing all these numbers, we find that the only solution is $q = 97$.\nThis implies $p = 63$. Hence, $b = 3p = 189$ and $d = 3q = 291$.\nHence, $c = \\frac{d - b}{2} = 51$. Therefore, the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $b + c + a = 189 + 51 + 219 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(459) }}$. ~Steven Chen (www.professorchenedu.com) We wish to solve the Diophantine equation $a^2+ab+b^2=3^2 \\cdot 73^2$. It can be shown that $3|a$ and $3|b$, so we make the substitution $a=3x$ and $b=3y$ to obtain $x^2+xy+y^2=73^2$ as our new equation to solve for. Notice that $r^2+r+1=(r-\\omega)(r-{\\omega}^2)$, where $\\omega=e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$. Thus,\n\n\n\\[x^2+xy+y^2 = y^2((x/y)^2+(x/y)+1) = y^2 (\\frac{x}{y}-\\omega)(\\frac{x}{y}-{\\omega}^2) = (x-y\\omega)(x-y{\\omega}^2).\\] Note that $8^2+1^2+8 \\cdot 1=73$. Thus, $(8-\\omega)(8-{\\omega}^2)=73$. Squaring both sides yields\n\n\n\\begin{align} (8-\\omega)^2(8-{\\omega}^2)^2&=73^2\\\\ (63-17\\omega)(63-17{\\omega}^2)&=73^2. \\end{align}\n\n\nThus, by $(2)$, $(63, 17)$ is a solution to $x^2+xy+y^2=73^2$. This implies that $a=189$ and $b=51$, so our final answer is $189+51+219=\\boxed{459}$. ~ Leo.Euler We look at upper and middle diagrams and get $\\angle BAC = 120^\\circ$.

Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be the corresponding side lengths for $\\angle A$, $\\angle B$, $\\angle C$. According to the question, $MH$ and $NG$ creates two sections of $\\triangle ABC$ of equal perimeter, we could list out the equations: $BG+C=a-BG$ $CH+b=a-BH$ $BG+GH+CH=a$ This results in: $BG=\\frac{a-c}{2}$ $CH=\\frac{a-b}{2}$ $GH=\\frac{b+c}{2}$ Now, we can apply the Menelaus Theorem to $\\triangle ABC$.\nLet $BE = x$ :\n\n\n\\[\\frac{BE}{AE}\\cdot\\frac{AN}{CN}\\cdot\\frac{CG}{BG} = 1\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{x+c}\\cdot1\\cdot\\frac{\\frac{a+c}{2}}{\\frac{a-c}{2}} = 1\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{x+c}\\cdot\\frac{a+c}{a-c} = 1\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\\frac{x+c}{x}=\\frac{a+c}{a-c}\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\\frac{c}{x}=\\frac{2c}{a-c}\\]\n\n\n\n\\[BE=x=\\frac{a-c}{2}=BG\\]\n\n\nSimilarly, $CF=CH$.

Finally, we just need $\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{c} \\rfloor$ to cover everything up to 1000.In addition, note that this function sometimes may not always minimize the number of stamps required.

Notice that among all numbers $1$ through $n$, only one of them can be a multiple of $2^e$, being $2^e$ itself.

Also, note that the congruence of $a$ (mod $5$ ) determines the set of congruences of $n^2 - na$ for each congruence of $n$ (mod $5$ ).For example, if $a \\equiv 1$ (mod $5$ ), the set of remainders is $(0, 2, 1, 2, 0)$ for $n \\equiv 1,2,3,4,0$ (mod $5$ ). Let the sum of these elements be $s$. Note that for each \u201cloop\u201d of the numerator (mod $5$ ), each element of the set will be subtracted exactly once, meaning $s$ is subtracted once for each loop. The value of the numerator will loop $404$ times (mod $5$ ) throughout the sum, as $5 \\cdot 404=2020$.

However, we will find that this is a negligible error when it comes to the inequality $-1000<U<1000$, so we can proceed with this approximation to solve for $a$.Factoring our approximation gives $U \\approx \\frac {\\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1 - 3a)}{6}-404s}{5}$We set $a= \\frac{(2n+1)}{3} = 1349$ to make $\\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1 - 3a)}{6}=0$, accordingly minimizing $|U|$, yielding $U \\approx \\frac{-404s}{5}$If $a$ increases or decreases by $1$, then $U$ changes by $\\frac {(n)(n+1)}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac {2023 \\cdot 2024}{10}$\nwhich clearly breaks the inequality on $U$.

This is convenient because $x \\mod{2^n}$ is simply the last $n$ -bits of $x$ in binary, and if $x \\equiv 1 \\mod{2^n}$, it means that of the last $n$ bits of $x$, only the rightmost bit (henceforth $0$ th bit) is $1$.Also, multiplication in binary can be thought of as adding shifted copies of the multiplicand. For example:\\begin{align} 10111_2 \\times 1011_2 &= 10111_2 \\times (1000_2 + 10_2 + 1_2) \\\\ &= 10111000_2 + 101110_2 + 10111_2 \\\\ &= 11111101_2 \\end{align}Now note $23 = 10111_2$, and recall that our objective is to progressively zero out the $n$ leftmost bits of $a_n = 10111_2 \\times b_n$ except for the $0$ th bit.Write $b_n = \\underline{c_{n-1}\\cdots c_2c_1c_0}_2$, we note that $c_0$ uniquely defines the $0$ th bit of $a_n$, and once we determine $c_0$, $c_1$ uniquely determines the $1$ st bit of $a_n$, so on and so forth.For example, $c_0 = 1$ satisfies $a_1 \\equiv10111_2 \\times 1_2 \\equiv 1 \\mod{10_2}$\nNext, we note that the second bit of $a_1$ is $1$, so we must also have $c_1 = 1$ in order to zero it out, giving\\[a_2 \\equiv 10111_2 \\times 11_2 \\equiv 101110_2 + a_1 \\equiv 1000101_2 \\equiv 01_2 \\mod{100_2}\\]$a_{n+1} = a_{n}$ happens precisely when $c_n = 0$. In fact we can see this in action by working out $a_3$. Note that $a_2$ has 1 on the $2$ nd bit, so we must choose $c_2 = 1$.

In fact, we find that the cycle length is $11$, and in the process found that $a_3 = a_4 = a_5$, $a_6 = a_7$, and $a_{11} = a_{12}$.Since we have $90$ complete cycles of length $11$, and the last partial cycle yields $a_{993} = a_{994} = a_{995}$ and $a_{996} = a_{997}$, we have a total of $90 \\times 4 + 3 = \\boxed{363}$ values of $n \\le 1000$ such that $a_n = a_{n+1}$~ cocoa @ https://www.corgillogical.com"]}, "2023_aime_ii_problems/problem_5": {"id": {"year": 2023, "contest_name": "AIME II", "problem_number": 5}, "title": "2023 AIME II Problems/Problem 5", "problem": "Let $S$ be the set of all positive rational numbers $r$ such that when the two numbers $r$ and $55r$ are written as fractions in lowest terms, the sum of the numerator and denominator of one fraction is the same as the sum of the numerator and denominator of the other fraction.

This is equivalent to $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ being divisible by each of these factors ( $2^4 = 16$, $3$, and $5^2 = 25$ ) separately, since they are coprime.Thus, for divisibility by $16$, we observe that $(2k+1)$ is necessarily odd, while exactly one of $k$ and $(k+1)$ is even. It follows that the (at least) $4$ factors of $2$ must be either all contained in $k$, or all contained in $(k+1)$, yielding $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$ or $k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$ respectively. This reduces to $k \\in \\left\\{0,15\\right\\} \\pmod{16}$.Next, if $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then obviously $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ will be divisible by 3; otherwise, we will have either $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, giving $2k+1 \\equiv 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\equiv 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, or $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, giving $k+1 \\equiv 2+1 \\equiv 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Hence $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is in fact always divisible by $3$, regardless of the value of $k$.Similarly, considering the cases $k \\equiv 0,1,2,3,4 \\pmod{5}$ in turn, the residues modulo $5$ of $k$, $(k+1)$, and $(2k+1)$ respectively are $0,1,1$ ; $1,2,3$ ; $2,3,0$ ; $3,4,2$ ; and $4,0,4$. As $0$ never appears more than once in any of these cases, we deduce that at most one of $k$, $(k+1)$, and $(2k+1)$ is divisible by 5. Analogously to above, it follows that the (at least) $2$ factors of $5$ must be either all contained in $k$, all contained in $(k+1)$, or all contained in $(2k+1)$. These respectively give $k,k+1,2k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$, which reduces to $k \\in \\left\\{0,12,24\\right\\} \\pmod{25}$.Accordingly, as there are $2$ possible residues for $k$ modulo $16$ and $3$ possible residues modulo $25$, we obtain a total of $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ pairs of simultaneous congruences. By the Chinese remainder theorem, as $16$ and $25$ are coprime, each pair has a unique solution modulo $16 \\cdot 25 = 400$, which we can easily calculate by simply writing out the solutions of the first congruence, then checking whether each of them also satisfies the second congruence.For instance, to solve $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$, $k \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, we can write out the positive multiples of $16$ (to satisfy the first congruence, together with the fact that $k > 0$ ), then subtract $12$ from each, until we find a multiple of $16$ for which this subtraction gives a multiple of $25$. As it turns out, $16 \\cdot 7 = 112$ and $112-12 = 100 = 25 \\cdot 4$, so the solution of this pair is precisely $k \\equiv 112 \\pmod{400}$.

Hence all solutions to the first condition are in the form:\n\n\\[(2 + \\sqrt {3})^{2k + 1} = a_k + \\sqrt {3}b_k\\]\n\nwhere $k = 0,1,2,..$. So we can (with very little effort) obtain the following: $(k,a_k = 2n) = (0,2),(1,26),(2,362),(3,5042)$. It is an AIME problem so it is implicit that $n < 1000$, so $2n < 2000$. It is easy to see that $a_n$ is strictly increasing by induction. Checking $2n = 362\\implies n =\\boxed{181}$ in the second condition works (we know $b_k$ is odd so we don't need to find $m$ ). So we're done.Let us generate numbers $1$ to $1000$ for the second condition, for squares. We know for $N$ to be integer, the squares must be odd. So we generate $N = 1, 21, 45, 73, 105, 141, 181, 381, 441, 721, 801$. $N$ cannot exceed $1000$ since it is AIME problem. Now take the first criterion, let $a$ be the smaller consecutive cube. We then get:$N^2 = (A + 1)^3 - A^3$$N^2 - 1 = 3A^2 + 3A$$(N + 1)(N - 1) = 3A(A + 1)$Now we know either $N + 1$ or $N - 1$ must be factor of $3$, hence $N = 1 \\pmod 3$ or $N = 2 \\pmod 3$. Only $1, 73, 181, 721$ satisfy this criterion. Testing each of the numbers in the condition yields $181$ as the largest that fits both, thus answer $= \\boxed{181}$."]}, "2009_indonesia_mo_problems/problem_2": {"id": {"year": 2009, "contest_name": "Indonesia MO", "problem_number": 2}, "title": "2009 Indonesia MO Problems/Problem 2", "problem": "For any real $x$, let $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ be the largest integer that is not more than $x$.

We easily solve this as $k \\equiv 24 \\mod 42$. Clearly, the sum of the first $6$ numbers must be $570$. In order for the first $5$ numbers to sum to a multiple of $5$, the sixth number must also be a multiple of $5$, since $30$ is a multiple of $5$. Thus, the only option is the sixth number is $10$, which gives $10+90= \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$~ firebolt360", "Let us simplify the problem. Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of $90$ and an integer between $1$ and $10$, we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between $1$ and $10$. Later, we can add $90$ to her score to obtain the real answer.From this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was $5$. We note that Isabella received $7$ integer scores out of $1$ to $10$. Since $5$ is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are $S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}$.The average score for the seven tests must be an integer. In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set $S$ above, and their sum with $5$ must be a multiple of $7$. The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from $1 +2+3+4+6+7=23$ to $4+6+7+8+9+10=44$. We must now find multiples of $7$ from the interval $23+5 = 28$ to $44+5=49$. There are four possibilities: $28$, $35$, $42$, $49$.\nHowever, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides $5$ ) must be a multiple of $6$ as well. Thus, $35$ is the only valid choice.(The six numbers sum to $30$.)Thus the sum of the six numbers equals to $30$. We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test. The sum must be a multiple of $5$. The possible interval is from $1+2+3+4+6=16$ to $6+7+8+9+10=40$. Since the sum of the five scores must be less than $30$, the only possibilities are $20$ and $25$. However, we notice that $25$ does not work because the seventh score turns out to be $5$ from the calculation. Therefore, the sum of Isabella's scores from test $1$ to $5$ is $20$. Therefore, her score on the sixth test is $10$.\nOur final answer is $10+90= \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$.", "Let $n$ be Isabella's average after $6$ tests. $6n+95 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, so $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.

Let $m$ be Isabella's average after $5$ tests, and let $a$ be her sixth test score. $5m+a= 6\\cdot95 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, so $a$ is a multiple of $5$. Since $100$ is the only choice that is a multiple of $5$, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$.", "Let $T$ be the total sum of Isabella's first five test scores, and let $S$ be her score on the sixth test. It follows that $T\\equiv 0\\pmod {5}$, $T+S\\equiv 0\\pmod {6}$, and $T+S+95\\equiv 0\\pmod {7}$, since at each step, her average score was an integer. Using the last equivalence, $T+S\\equiv -95\\equiv 3\\pmod{7}$, so we have a system of equivalences for $T+S$. Solving this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we get $T+S\\equiv (0)(7)(1)+(3)(6)(-1) \\equiv -18 \\equiv 24 \\pmod{42}$.Now let's put a bound on $T$. Using the given information that each test score was a distinct integer from $91$ to $100$ inclusive and that the seventh score was 95, we get $91+92+93+94+96\\leq T\\leq 100+99+98+97+96$.

Let $a_n$ denote the average of the first $n$ scores. We are given that all $a_n$ are integers. If the $a_6$ is different from the $a_7$, then the last score must be a multiple of 7 away from $a_6$. However, $95-7=88$ and $95+7=102$ clearly cannot be $a_6$ since they are outside the range of 91 to 100. Thus, $a_6$ must be 95. Additionally, $a_5$ cannot be 95 since that would mean the sixth score is 95, which isn't possible since scores can't repeat (also, it's not an answer choice). Intuitively, $a_5$ should be close to 95 due to the constraint on the range of scores. We can try 94 and 96 for $a_5$. Again, the sixth score must be a multiple of 6 (preferably only one multiple) away from $a_5$.
